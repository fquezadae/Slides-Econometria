               redistribution of many marine species, including those that
               support fisheries. A combination of gradual climate trends and
               shorter‐lived extreme events, such as marine heatwaves, can
               change the availability of species or stocks to fishing ports,
               impacting fishing communities and challenging fisheries
               management frameworks. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the
               California Current System are currently considered as two
               subpopulations for management purposes. They are separated from
               each other using oceanographic conditions, based on the
               assumption that each subpopulation is associated with different
               habitats and geographic areas. However, as climate change and
               marine heatwaves lead to increasingly novel environmental
               conditions in the region, habitat‐based assignments may become
               impractical or unrealistic. In this study, we use generalized
               additive models to define sea surface temperature and surface
               chlorophyll conditions associated with the occurrence of multiple
               sardine life stages in fishery‐independent surveys conducted in
               the California Current System. We then show how the spatial
               distribution of habitats across life stages and putative
               subpopulations may be influenced by both gradual climate change
               and marine heatwaves. Our results highlight the potential impacts
               of changing ocean conditions near major sardine landing ports.
               During recent marine heatwaves, habitat associated with the
               northern subpopulation became less available to southern
               California Current ports, and this trend is projected to continue
               through the end of the 21st century. Future spatial shifts in
               sardine habitat may increasingly challenge the practicality of
               habitat‐based subpopulation separation and introduce more
               uncertainty into management frameworks.",

               diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis. It was unprecedented in its
               toxicity and geographic extent and resulted in extended and
               widespread closures of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab
               and popular recreational razor clam fisheries. The fishery
               closures led to federal fisheries disaster declarations and
               generated an economic shock for coastal communities that depend
               on access to these marine resources. This study reports on the
               socioeconomic impacts of the 2015 HAB across 16 fishing
               communities on the U.S. West Coast using primary survey data. The
               survey instrument, deployed in the summer of 2017, collected
               information on sociodemographic and economic factors hypothesized
               to confer resilience or vulnerability to HABs, data quantifying
               individual impacts, and the coping and adaptive actions taken by
               individuals to deal with the event. The vast majority of survey
               participants (84\%) were negatively impacted by the 2015 HAB, but

               (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were
               more sensitive to projected climate change, while demersal groups
               like Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) experienced smaller
               changes due to counteracting effects of spatial distribution

              Previous studies suggest that the magnitude of the decline in
              primary production on apex predators could be amplified through
              the trophodynamics of marine food webs, leading to larger
              decreases in the biomass of predators relative to the decrease in
              primary production, a mechanism called trophic amplification. We
              compared relative changes in producer and consumer biomass or
              production in the global ocean to assess the extent of trophic
              amplification. We used simulations from nine marine ecosystem
              models (MEMs) from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Models
              Intercomparison Project forced by two Earth System Models under
              the high greenhouse gas emissions Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
              (SSP5-8.5) and a scenario of no fishing. Globally, total consumer
              biomass is projected to decrease by 16.7 ± 9.5\% more than net
              primary production (NPP) by 2090-2099 relative to 1995-2014, with
              substantial variations among MEMs and regions. Total consumer
              biomass is projected to decrease almost everywhere in the ocean
              (80\% of the world's oceans) in the model ensemble. In 40\% of the
              world's oceans, consumer biomass was projected to decrease more
              than NPP. Additionally, in another 36\% of the world's oceans
              consumer biomass is expected to decrease even as projected NPP
              increases. By analysing the biomass response within food webs in
              available MEMs, we found that model parameters and structures
              contributed to more complex responses than a consistent
              amplification of climate impacts of higher trophic levels. Our
              study provides additional insights into the ecological mechanisms

               have analysed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine
               species in order to recommend best practice in future studies.
               This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open
               Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed
               (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number
               of papers significantly increased through time (R2=0.92, p<0.05).
               The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate
               Northern Atlantic (45\%) followed by studies of global scale
               (11\%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10\%). The majority
               of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37\%)
               including investigations of biological invasions by non-native
               organisms, conservation planning (19\%), and climate change

               ecological, multidisciplinary or biodiversity conservation
               journals. Most of the studies (94\%) failed to report the amount
               of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model
               parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to
               ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the
               main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and
               analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data.
               We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should
               report on key features of the approaches employed, data
               deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and
               the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition,
               based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine
               SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the

               a mixed layer temperature budget, these anomalies were caused by
               lower than normal rates of the loss of heat from the ocean to the
               atmosphere and of relatively weak cold advection in the upper
               ocean. Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually

               normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This
               anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least
               the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies
               subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and
               summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are

This paper explores just one facet of livelihood diversity, namely the reasons for households to adopt multiple livelihood strategies. The distinction is made between diversification of necessity and diversification by choice. Six determinants of diversification are considered in the light of that distinction, and these are seasonality, risk, labour markets, credit markets, asset strategies, and coping strategies. The paper concludes that under the precarious conditions that characterise rural survival in many low income countries, diversification has positive attributes for livelihood security that outweigh negative connotations it may possess. Policy should facilitate rather than inhibit diversity. Diverse rural livelihoods are less vulnerable than undiversified ones.},

It is found that there has been a significant structural shift of household income away from farm to nonfarm income sources, as well as a reduction in the income gap and the difference in poverty incidence between favorable and unfavorable regions. Such decreases in poverty and its regional gap have been associated with the declining importance of income accrued to farm land, measured by farm size and the availability of irrigation, and with the increasing importance of human capital, measured by the proportion of working members who have graduated from post lower secondary schools. Such findings indicate that the success in rural poverty reduction in Thailand has resulted from the development of the rural nonfarm sector coupled with the improvement of the schooling levels of the rural population.},

               reorganization are difficult to observe and summarize, but are
               critical aspects of predicting and rapidly assessing community
               vulnerability to extreme events. We apply network analysis to
               evaluate the impact of a climate shock-an unprecedented marine
               heatwave-on patterns of resource use in California fishing
               communities, which were severely affected through closures of the
               Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified
               flows of users between fishery resources during the closures.
               These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of
               resource use and were associated with three strategies used by
               fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures:
               temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the
               Dungeness crab fishery into other fisheries, and spatial shifts

               continually adapting in response to different sources of
               variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem
               change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts
               to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of
               alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize
               fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for
               all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine
               Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of
               nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are
               proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries
               connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US
               California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness
               crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences,

               connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance

               technological and management change while at the same time
               enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing

              biological and ecological processes. Ecosystem models are one tool
              that can be used to simulate how the complex impacts of climate
              change may manifest in a warming world. In this study, we used an
              end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model to compare and contrast the
              effects of climate-driven species redistribution and projected
              temperature from three separate climate models on species of key
              commercial importance in the California Current Ecosystem.
              Adopting a scenario analysis approach, we used Atlantis to measure
              differences in the biomass, abundance, and weight at age of
              pelagic and demersal species among six simulations for the years
              2013–2100 and tracked the implications of those changes for
              spatially defined California Current fishing fleets. The
              simulations varied in their use of forced climate-driven species
              distribution shifts, time-varying projections of ocean warming, or
              both. In general, the abundance and biomass of coastal pelagic
              species like Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern
              anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were more sensitive to projected
              climate change, while demersal groups like Dover sole (Microstomus
              pacificus) experienced smaller changes due to counteracting
              effects of spatial distribution change and metabolic effects of
              warming. Climate-driven species distribution shifts and the
              resulting changes in food web interactions were more influential
              than warming on end-of-century biomass and abundance patterns.
              Spatial projections of changes in fisheries catch did not always
              align with changes in abundance of their targeted species. This
              mismatch is likely due to species distribution shifts into or out
              of fishing areas and emphasizes the importance of a spatially
              explicit understanding of both climate change effects and fishing
              dynamics. We illuminate important biological and ecological
              pathways through which climate change acts in an ecosystem context

               that, if managed strategically, could enhance diet quality for
               billions of people. However, optimising nutrient production from
               the sea has not been a priority, hindering development of
               nutrition-sensitive policies. With fisheries management
               increasingly effective at rebuilding stocks and regulating
               sustainable fishing, we can now begin to integrate nutritional
               outcomes within existing management frameworks. Here, we develop
               a conceptual foundation for managing fisheries for multispecies
               Maximum Nutrient Yield (mMNY). We empirically test our approach
               using size-based models of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries and
               show that mMNY is predicted by the relative contribution of
               nutritious species to total catch and their vulnerability to
               fishing, leading to trade-offs between catch and specific
               nutrients. Simulated nutrient yield curves suggest that vitamin
               D, which is deficient in Northern European diets, was underfished
               at fishing levels that returned maximum catch weights. Analysis
               of global catch data shows there is scope for nutrient yields
               from most of the world's marine fisheries to be enhanced through
               nutrient-sensitive fisheries management. With nutrient
               composition data now widely available, we expect our mMNY
               framework to motivate development of nutrient-based reference
               points in specific contexts, such as data-limited fisheries.
               Managing for mMNY alongside policies that promote access to fish
               could help close nutrient gaps for coastal populations,
               maximising the contribution of wild-caught fish to global food

               Huge fluctuations in abundance have traditionally been associated
               with external environmental forcing on recruitment, exempting
               other processes from contributing to fisheries collapse. On the
               other hand, theory predicts that density dependence and
               overexploitation can increase the likelihood of population
               oscillations. Here, we combined nonlinear population modeling
               with Bayesian analysis to examine the importance of different
               regulatory mechanisms on the collapse of European anchovy
               (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The approach
               relied on detailed population data and in a careful
               characterization of changes in the environment experienced by
               anchovy early stages based mainly on satellite remote sensing.
               Alternative hypotheses about external forcing on recruitment
               determined prediction skill and provided alternative
               interpretations of the causes behind the collapse. Density
               dependence was weak and unable to generate huge oscillations.
               Instead, models considering changes in phytoplankton phenology or
               in larval drift presented the best prediction skill.
               Nevertheless, an extensive surrogate analysis showed that
               environmental fluctuations alone barely explain anchovy collapse
               without considering the impact of fishing. Our results highlight
               the effectiveness of a Bayesian approach to analyze the dynamics

               In Europe's Common Fisheries Policy, the share of the catch of

               allocation key known as ‘Relative Stability’: in each management
               area, member states get the same proportion of the total catch
               each year. That proportion is largely based on catches made by
               those member states in the 1970s. Changes in distribution can,
               therefore, result in a mismatch between quota shares and regional
               abundances within management areas, with potential repercussions
               for the status of fish stocks and the fisheries that depend on

               density‐dependent use of these areas, are at least partly
               responsible for the observed changes. These findings challenge

               fishing fleets we have explored a suite of case studies
               encompassing the northeast and tropical Atlantic, the
               Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas. This study shows that
               European Union (EU) fisheries are likely resilient to
               climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively
               impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However,
               fisheries’ long-term stock resilience can be improved (and
               therefore be more resilient to increasing changes in climate) by
               adopting robust and adaptive fisheries management, provided such
               measures are based on sound scientific advice which includes
               uncertainty. Such management requires regular updates of
               biological reference points. Such updates will delineate safe
               biological limits for exploitation, providing both high long-term
               yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by
               short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid
               higher than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience
               of the exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the
               resilience of the economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks
               associated with reduced yields, neither to a reduced carbon
               footprint if fuel use increases from lower stock abundances. Fuel
               consumption is impacted by stock development, but also by changes
               in vessel and gear technologies, as well as fishing techniques.
               In this respect, energy-efficient fishing technologies already
               exist within the EU, though implementing them would require
               improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to
               stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and
               increased catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel
               consumption and costs would need to be supported by the setup of
               EU regulatory instruments. Overall, to effectively manage EU
               fisheries within a changing climate, flexible, adaptive,
               well-informed and well-enforced management is needed, with
               incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to cope
               with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency
               of the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such
               management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize ‘win-win’
               fishing strategies for the European Union, which develop
               leverages in which fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum
               Sustainable Yield targets and Common Fisheries Policy minimal
               effects objectives. In these strategies, higher catch is obtained
               in the long run, less fuel is spent to attain the catch, and the
               fisheries have a higher resistance and resilience to shock and
               long-term factors to face climate-induced stresses.",

  abstract  = "AbstractThe Peru‐Humboldt Current system (HCS) supports the
               world's largest pelagic fisheries. Among the world's eastern
               boundary current systems, it is the most exposed to high climatic
               stress and is directly affected by El Niño and La Niña events. In
               this volatile ecosystem, fish have been led to develop adaptive
               strategies in space and time. In this paper, we attempt to
               understand the mechanisms underlying such strategies, focusing on
               the El Niño 1997–98 in Peru from which an extensive set of
               hydrographic, capture and acoustic survey data are available. An
               integrated analysis of the data is crucial, as each has
               substantial shortcomings individually; for example, both catch
               data and acoustic surveys may easily lead to wrong conclusions.
               Existing hypotheses on anchovy and sardine alternations lead us
               to a ‘habitat‐based’ synthetic hypothesis. Using our data, an
               integrated approach evaluated how fish responded to habitat
               variation, and determined the consequences in terms of
               fish‐population variability. Various factors occurring at a range
               of different spatio‐temporal scales were considered: interdecadal
               regime (warm ‘El Viejo’/cool ‘La Vieja’ decadal scale); strength
               and the duration of the El Niño Southern Oscillation event
               (interannual scale); population condition before the event
               (interannual scale); fishing pressure and other predation (annual
               scale); changes in reproductive behaviour (intra‐annual scale);
               presence of local upwelling (local scale). During El Niño
               1997–98, anchovy was able to exploit a small‐scale temporal and
               spatial ‘loophole’ inside the general unfavourable conditions.
               Moreover, sardine did not do better than anchovy during this El
               Niño and was not able to take advantage of the ‘loophole’ opened
               by this short‐term event. Our results question the traditional
               view that El Niño is bad for anchovy and good for sardine.",

               2013–2014 and in the spring between 2014–2017 and 2021. In the

              perturbations during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic,
              affecting the livelihoods of millions of fishers worldwide. In the
              Northeast United States, fishers grappled with low prices and
              disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to
              the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing

              investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the
              COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the
              Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on
              participation in the fishery and fishers' economic outcomes, using
              data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S.
              commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of
              those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies
              to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found
              the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months
              of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing.
              Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by
              disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a
              resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate
              that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species,
              it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers
              reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including
              direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing
              their income with government payments or other sources of income.
              Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return,
              suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation
              strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite
              economic losses, fishers in the Northeast U.S. demonstrated
              resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and
              implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to
              other livelihoods.",

              heatwaves revealed the high vulnerability of marine ecosystems3-11
              and fisheries12-14 to such extreme climate events. Yet our
              knowledge about past occurrences15 and the future progression of
              MHWs is very limited. Here we use satellite observations and a
              suite of Earth system model simulations to show that MHWs have
              already become longer-lasting and more frequent, extensive and
              intense in the past few decades, and that this trend will
              accelerate under further global warming. Between 1982 and 2016, we
              detect a doubling in the number of MHW days, and this number is
              projected to further increase on average by a factor of 16 for
              global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial
              levels and by a factor of 23 for global warming of 2.0 degrees
              Celsius. However, current national policies for the reduction of
              global carbon emissions are predicted to result in global warming
              of about 3.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first
              century16, for which models project an average increase in the
              probability of MHWs by a factor of 41. At this level of warming,
              MHWs have an average spatial extent that is 21 times bigger than
              in preindustrial times, last on average 112 days and reach maximum
              sea surface temperature anomaly intensities of 2.5 degrees
              Celsius. The largest changes are projected to occur in the western
              tropical Pacific and Arctic oceans. Today, 87 per cent of MHWs are
              attributable to human-induced warming, with this ratio increasing
              to nearly 100 per cent under any global warming scenario exceeding
              2 degrees Celsius. Our results suggest that MHWs will become very
              frequent and extreme under global warming, probably pushing marine
              organisms and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience and
              even beyond, which could cause irreversible changes.",

               on additional risks such as fishing in poor weather, overloading

               Rights-based management is expected to reduce the incentives to
               take on additional risk. Using a large dataset of fishers from
               around the United States, we empirically estimate the effects of

              The sensitivity of spring/summer-time coastal upwelling systems to
              climate change has recently received a lot of attention. Several
              studies have suggested that their intensity may increase in the
              future while other authors have shown decreasing intensity in
              their equatorward portions. Yet, recent observations do not show
              robust evidence of this intensification. The Senegalo-Mauritanian
              upwelling system (SMUS) located at the southern edge of the north
              Atlantic system (12°N–20°N) and most active in winter/spring has
              been largely excluded from these studies. Here, the seasonal cycle
              of the SMUS and its response to climate change is investigated in
              the database of the Coupled Models Inter comparison Project Phase
              5 (CMIP5). Upwelling magnitude and surface signature are
              characterized by several sea surface temperature and wind stress
              indices. We highlight the ability of the climate models to
              reproduce the system, as well as their biases. The simulations
              suggest that the intensity of the SMUS winter/spring upwelling
              will moderately decrease in the future, primarily because of a
              reduction of the wind forcing linked to a northward shift of
              Azores anticyclone and a more regional modulation of the low
              pressures found over Northwest Africa. The implications of such an

              catch regime ended up with a fishery crash and closure (2005–2009)
              after a series of recruitment failures. Precautionary advices had
              been disregarded due to their inability to predict the size of the
              population during the first half of the year when the major
              fishery takes place. The crash triggered the EU to develop a
              long-term management plan in 2008. In the absence of a recruitment
              indicator, biological risk was minimized through a close coupling
              between assessment, advice and management, changing the management
              year to start just after the spring surveys on adults. A major
              improvement arrived in 2014 by the incorporation of an early
              recruitment indicator from an autumn acoustic survey on juveniles.
              This allowed additional exploitation of the resource at similar
              risk levels. Accordingly, TACs are nowadays set after the recruit
              survey on a management calendar basis. The interactive
              collaboration between fishers, scientists, and managers allowed
              inclusion of the stakeholders’ preferences for a biomass-based
              catch bounded harvest strategy suitable for these valuable
              fisheries. This strategy allows catches between a minimum and

              activity when approaching a minimum biomass threshold level, and
              for the limited market absorption capacity when exceeding an upper
              biomass threshold level, respectively. Such strategy was adopted

               directly upon natural resources for their livelihoods and

               local- and regional-scale impacts and associated risks can vary

               adaptation pathways that will be most effective for specific
               communities are underexplored. To improve this understanding at
               relevant local scales, we developed a coupled social-ecological
               approach to assess the risk posed to fishing fleets by climate
               change, applying it to a case study of groundfish fleets that are
               a cornerstone of fisheries along the U.S. West Coast. Based on
               the mean of three high-resolution climate projections, we found
               that more poleward fleets may experience twice as much local
               temperature change as equatorward fleets, and 3–4 times as much
               depth displacement of historical environmental conditions in
               their fishing grounds. Not only are they more highly exposed to
               climate change, but some poleward fleets are >10x more
               economically-dependent on groundfish. While we show clear
               regional differences in fleets’ flexibility to shift to new
               fisheries via fisheries diversification (‘adapt in-place’) or
               shift their fishing grounds in response to future change through
               greater mobility (‘adapt on-the-move’), these differences do not
               completely mitigate the greater exposure and economic dependence
               of more poleward fleets. Therefore, on the U.S. West Coast more
               poleward fishing fleets may be at greater overall risk due to
               climate change, in contrast to expectations for greater
               equatorward risk in other parts of the world. Through integration
               of climatic, ecological, and socio-economic data, this case study
               illustrates the potential for widespread implementation of risk
               assessment at scales relevant to fishers, communities, and
               decision makers. Such applications will help identify the

              this study is to undertake a time-series analysis of climate
              change (CC) indicators within the Bay of Biscay, including the
              Basque coast. We used an integrated and flexible methodology,
              based on Generalized Additive Mixed Models, to detect trends on 19
              indicators (including marine physics, chemistry, atmosphere,
              hydrology, geomorphology, biodiversity, and commercial species).
              The results of 87 long-term time series analysed (~512,000
              observations), in the last four decades, indicate four groups of
              climate regime shifts: 1) A gradual shift associated with CC
              starting in the 1980s, with a warming of the sea surface down to
              100 m depth in the bay (0.10-0.25 °C per decade), increase in air
              temperature and insolation. This warming may have impacted on
              benthic community redistribution in the Basque coast, favouring
              warm-water species relative to cold-water species. Weight at age
              for anchovy and sardine decreased in the last two decades. 2)
              Deepening of the winter mixed layer depth in the south-eastern bay
              that probably led to increases in nutrients, surface oxygen, and
              chlorophyll concentration. Current increases on chlorophyll and
              zooplankton (i.e., copepods) biomass are contrary to those
              expected under CC scenarios in the region. 3) Sea-level rise
              (1.5-3.5 cm per decade since 1990s), associated with CC. 4)
              Increase of extreme wave height events of 16.8 cm per decade in
              the south-eastern bay, probably related to stormy conditions in
              the last decade, with impacts on beach erosion. Estimating
              accurate rates of sea warming, sea-level rise, extreme events, and
              foreseeing the future pathways of marine productivity, are key to
              define the best adaptation measures to minimize negative CC

              set by changing environmental conditions dampening individuals'
              growth. However, other processes such as growth compensation and
              non-directional selection can occur and their importance on the
              overall phenotypic response of exploited populations has largely
              been ignored. Using otolith growth data collected in European
              anchovy and sardine of the Bay of Biscay (18 cohorts from 2000 to
              2018), we parameterized the breeder's equation to determine
              whether declines in size-at-age in these species were due to an
              adaptive response (i.e. related to directional or non-directional
              selection differentials within parental cohorts) or a plastic
              response (i.e. related to changes in environmental). We found that
              growth at age-0 in anchovy declined between parents and their
              offspring when biomass increased and the selective disappearance
              of large individuals was high in parents. Therefore, an adaptive
              response probably occurred in years with high fishing effort and
              the large increase in biomass after the collapse of this stock
              maintained this adaptive response subsequently. In sardine
              offspring, higher growth at age-0 was associated with increasing
              biomass between parents and offspring, suggesting a plastic
              response to a bottom-up process (i.e. a change in food quantity or
              quality). Parental cohorts in which selection favoured individuals
              with high growth compensation produced offspring high catch up
              growth rates, which may explain the smaller decline in growth in
              sardine relative to anchovy. Finally, on non-directional selection
              differentials were not significantly related to the changes in
              growth at age-0 and growth compensation at age-1 in both species.
              Although anchovy and sardine have similar ecologies, the
              mechanisms underlying the declines in their growth are clearly
              different. The consequences of the exploitation of natural

              catch regime ended up with a fishery crash and closure (2005–2009)
              after a series of recruitment failures. Precautionary advices had
              been disregarded due to their inability to predict the size of the
              population during the first half of the year when the major
              fishery takes place. The crash triggered the EU to develop a
              long-term management plan in 2008. In the absence of a recruitment
              indicator, biological risk was minimized through a close coupling
              between assessment, advice and management, changing the management
              year to start just after the spring surveys on adults. A major
              improvement arrived in 2014 by the incorporation of an early
              recruitment indicator from an autumn acoustic survey on juveniles.
              This allowed additional exploitation of the resource at similar
              risk levels. Accordingly, TACs are nowadays set after the recruit
              survey on a management calendar basis. The interactive
              collaboration between fishers, scientists, and managers allowed
              inclusion of the stakeholders’ preferences for a biomass-based
              catch bounded harvest strategy suitable for these valuable
              fisheries. This strategy allows catches between a minimum and
              maximum TAC level, to account for an economically viable minimum
              activity when approaching a minimum biomass threshold level, and
              for the limited market absorption capacity when exceeding an upper
              biomass threshold level, respectively. Such strategy was adopted
              by consensus and supposed a successful participatory process in
              fishery management.",

              play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from
              plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish,
              seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far
              reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in
              place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels,
              where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However,
              disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes
              on population dynamics has been difficult because of the
              sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we
              overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for
              forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of
              global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of
              fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population
              collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high
              fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop
              in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to
              reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity
              declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring
              population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and
              frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural
              productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to
              fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different
              from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A
              risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations
              become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from
              collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.",

              emergence of shrinking trends and the prevalence of
              temperature-driven changes in size over alternative drivers. In
              marine fish, changes in food availability or fluctuations in
              abundance, including those due to size-selective fishing, provide
              compelling mechanisms to explain changes in body size. Here, based
              on three decades of scientific survey data (1990-2021), we report
              a decline in the average body size-length and weight-of anchovy,
              Engraulis encrasicolus L., in the Bay of Biscay. Shrinking was
              evident in all age classes, from juveniles to adults. Allometric
              adjustment indicated slightly more pronounced declines in weight
              than in total length, which is consistent with a change toward a
              slender body shape. Trends in adult weight were nonlinear, with
              rates accelerating to an average decline of up to 25\% decade-1
              during the last two decades. We found a strong association between
              higher anchovy abundance and reduced juvenile size. The effect of
              density dependence was less clear later in life, and temperature
              became the best predictor of declines in adult size. Theoretical
              analyses based on a strategic model further suggested that
              observed patterns are consistent with a simultaneous, opposing
              effect of rising temperatures on accelerating early growth and
              decreasing adult size as predicted by the temperature-size rule.
              Macroecological assessment of ecogeographical-Bergmann's and
              James'-rules in anchovy size suggested that the observed decline
              largely exceeds intraspecific variation and might be the result of

              study recommend caution and a continued assessment and exploration
              of alternative drivers. Additional evidence of a climate-driven
              regime shift in the region suggests, however, that shrinking
              anchovy sizes may signal a long-lasting change in the structure
              and functioning of the Bay of Biscay ecosystem.",

              three regions of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea: the
              English Channel in the north, to the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of
              Lion in the south. We developed a bioenergetic modeling framework

              were forced using two different representations of the lower
              trophic levels, POLCOMS-ERSEM and SEAPODYM models. Our models were
              calibrated for the Bay of Biscay and then projected on to the

              the early 2010s (period with smaller fish). The environment alone,
              temperature and zooplankton, explained a significant part of the
              observed regional differences in growth. However, the temporal
              trends simulated by the lower trophic levels models, when
              transcribed through bioenergetics, could not explain the strong
              decrease in length and weight that occurred in the Bay of Biscay
              (-30 \% in weight for anchovy and −20 \% for sardine) and in the

              a scenario approach, we estimated that a decrease in zooplankton
              quality could be a significant driver of the observed decrease in
              size both in the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lion (decrease
              in assimilable energy of 4 to 5 \% and 15 to 17 \% in the Bay of
              Biscay and the Gulf of Lion, respectively). For such a decrease in
              size, a zooplankton biomass of the same quality should have been
              reduced by between 17 and 31 \% in the Bay of Biscay over a 10- to
              15-year period, while no biologically realistic estimations were

               since Holling’s (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations
               of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion.
               Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the
               attributes that govern the system’s dynamics. Three related
               attributes of social–ecological systems (SESs) determine their
               future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and
               transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb
               disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still
               retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and
               feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance,
               precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the
               metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity
               of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES,
               essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which
               this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of
               resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a
               fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social
               structures make the existing system untenable. The implications
               of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science
               include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the
               determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to
               resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive

               adaptive systems and addresses the question of how human
               institutions might be best matched to their structure and
               function. Ocean ecosystems operate at multiple scales, but the
               management of fisheries tends to be aimed at a single species
               considered at a single broad scale. The paper argues that this
               mismatch of ecological and management scale makes it difficult to
               address the fine-scale aspects of ocean ecosystems, and leads to
               fishing rights and strategies that tend to erode the underlying
               structure of populations and the system itself. A successful
               transition to ecosystem-based management will require
               institutions better able to economize on the acquisition of
               feedback about the impact of human activities. This is likely to
               be achieved by multiscale institutions whose organization mirrors
               the spatial organization of the ecosystem and whose
               communications occur through a polycentric network. Better
               feedback will allow the exploration of fine-scale science and the
               employment of fine-scale fishing restraints, better adapted to
               the behavior of fish and habitat. The scale and scope of
               individual fishing rights also needs to be congruent with the
               spatial structure of the ecosystem. Place-based rights can be
               expected to create a longer private planning horizon as well as
               stronger incentives for the private and public acquisition of
               system relevant knowledge.]",

              to these changes (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine

              empirical evidence linking theoretical measures of adaptive
              capacity to community and household responses remains limited.
              Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis examining how metrics of
              adaptive capacity translate to human responses to change (Adapt,
              React, Cope response) in 22 small-scale fishing case studies from
              20 countries (n = 191 responses). Using both thematic and
              qualitative comparative analysis, we evaluate how responses to
              climate, environmental, and social change were influenced by
              domains of adaptive capacity. Our findings show that adaptive
              responses at the community level only occurred in situations where
              the community had Access to Assets, in combination with other
              domains including Diversity and Flexibility, Learning and
              Knowledge, and Natural Capital. In contrast, Access to Assets was
              nonessential for adaptive responses at the household level.
              Adaptive households demonstrated Diversity and Flexibility when
              supported by strong Governance or Institutions and were often able
              to substitute Learning and Knowledge and Natural Capital with one
              another. Standardized metrics of adaptive capacity are essential
              to designing effective policies promoting resilience in natural
              resource-dependent communities and understanding how social and
              ecological aspects of communities interact to influence responses.
              Our framework describes how small-scale fishing communities and

               is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will
               embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface
               and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces
               the ERA‐Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was
               started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting
               System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus
               benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core
               dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly
               enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for
               ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an
               uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3‐hourly at half the
               horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set‐up
               of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and
               performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which
               is currently publicly available. Re‐forecasts from ERA5 analyses
               show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to
               ERA‐Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to
               assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and
               humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A
               comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit
               for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the
               evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced
               temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution
               of weather systems. For precipitation, global‐mean correlation
               with monthly‐mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In
               general, low‐frequency variability is found to be well
               represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of
               anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA‐Interim,

              bycatch—the inadvertent harvesting and discard of non-targeted
              species. Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species
              coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective.
              One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the
              common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total
              allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted
              species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs
              binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that
              is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model
              demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized
              by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target
              species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low
              bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our
              predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of
              spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we
              derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its

              regulators.",

               the price forecasts used by fishers in a model which generates
               expected profits for three fishing locations in the British
               Columbia salmon fishery. A random utility model of fishing
               location choice is then estimated using two different sets of
               regressors. The first is expected seasonal profit and its
               variability. The second is expected wealth and its variability,
               where expected wealth is taken to be the sum of the known
               preseason wealth and the expected profitability of a given
               fishing location. Results show that expected profitability is a
               significant determinant of fishing location choice but that
               expected wealth plays an even bigger role. This suggests that
               there is a type of wealth or stock effect present in decisions
               made by fishers. The results also provide evidence that the
               variability of profits or wealth is generally a less significant
               component in regard to fishing location choice. In fact, some
               fishers thrive on greater variability, thereby providing some
               evidence of the risk loving behaviour typically attributed to
               fishers. This is not the case, however, for all fishers since
               some are found to be risk-neutral and even risk-averse. Given the
               finding that fishers do respond to economic incentives, one
               policy implication concerns the ability of fisheries managers to
               alter the dispersion of fishers over fishing locations via the
               adjustment of the economic incentives by means of differential
               royalty taxes. A second policy implication results from the
               finding of risk-loving behaviour. This calls into question models
               that assume risk-averse behaviour and predict a dominance of
               crop-sharing contracts over wage contracts.",

              management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities
              have evolved different models, using different review standards,
              and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research
              shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density
              for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a
              “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem,
              habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history
              and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package,
              the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then
              provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by
              users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or
              multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal
              variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model;
              whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to
              include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally
              demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first
              develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range
              expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the
              Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species.
              The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in
              the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the
              different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides
              elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover
              sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term
              forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five
              groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast
              groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual
              variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod
              (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research
              exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency”
              approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments,

              change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and
              to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in
              calcification, and increases in the abundance of warm-water
              species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species
              responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and
              taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the
              heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the
              impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of
              changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing
              oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean
              acidification. Observations of species responses that have been
              linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are
              still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton,
              benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).",

               major concern over the last decades. It is now imperative to
               improve the way we project the effects of future climate warming
               on fisheries. While estimating future climate-induced changes in
               fish distribution is an important contribution to sustainable
               resource management, the impacts on European small pelagic
               fish?representing over 50\% of the landings in the Mediterranean
               and Black Sea between 2000 and 2013?are yet largely understudied.
               Here, we investigated potential changes in the spatial
               distribution of seven of the most harvested small pelagic fish
               species in Europe under several climate change scenarios over the
               21st century. For each species, we considered eight Species
               Distribution Models (SDMs), five General Circulation Models
               (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (the IPCC Representative
               Concentration Pathways; RCPs). Under all scenarios, our results
               revealed that the environmental suitability for most of the seven
               species may strongly decrease in the Mediterranean and western
               North Sea while increasing in the Black and Baltic Seas. This
               potential northward range expansion of species is supported by a
               strong convergence among projections and a low variability
               between RCPs. Under the most pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5),
               climate-related local extinctions were expected in the
               south-eastern Mediterranean basin. Our results highlight that a
               multi-SDM, multi-GCM, multi-RCP approach is needed to produce
               more robust ecological scenarios of changes in exploited fish
               stocks in order to better anticipate the economic and social
               consequences of global climate change.",

              species is a major observed and predicted impact of these
              oceanographic changes, and such shifts may modify fish community
              structure considerably in particular locations and regions. We
              projected future range shifts of pelagic marine fishes of the
              Northeast Pacific shelf seas by 2050 relative to the present. We
              combined published data, expert knowledge, and pelagic fish survey
              data to predict current species distribution ranges of 28 fish
              species of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas that occur in the
              epipelagic zone and are well-represented in pelagic fish surveys.
              These represent a wide spectrum of sub-tropical to sub-polar
              species, with a wide range of life history characteristics. Using
              projected ocean condition changes from three different Earth
              System Models, we simulated changes in the spatial distribution of
              each species. We show that Northeast Pacific shelf seas may
              undergo considerable changes in the structure of its pelagic
              marine communities by mid-21st century. Ensembles of model
              projections suggest that the distribution centroids of the studied
              species are expected to shift poleward at an average rate of
              30.1±2.34 (S.E.) km decade−1 under the SRES A2 scenario from 2000
              to 2050. The projected species range shifts result in a high rate
              of range expansion of this group of species into the Gulf of
              Alaska and the Bering Sea. Rate of range contraction of these
              species is highest at the Aleutian Islands, and in the California
              Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We also predict increasing
              dominance of warmer water species in all regions. The projected
              changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and
              socio-economic implications through mismatches of co-evolved
              species, unexpected trophic effects, and shifts of fishing
              grounds. These results provide hypotheses of climate change

              that, if managed strategically, could enhance diet quality for

              the sea has not been a priority, hindering development of
              nutrition-sensitive policies. With fisheries management
              increasingly effective at rebuilding stocks and regulating
              sustainable fishing, we can now begin to integrate nutritional
              outcomes within existing management frameworks. Here, we develop a
              conceptual foundation for managing fisheries for multispecies
              Maximum Nutrient Yield (mMNY). We empirically test our approach
              using size-based models of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries and
              show that mMNY is predicted by the relative contribution of
              nutritious species to total catch and their vulnerability to
              fishing, leading to trade-offs between catch and specific
              nutrients. Simulated nutrient yield curves suggest that vitamin D,
              which is deficient in Northern European diets, was underfished at
              fishing levels that returned maximum catch weights. Analysis of
              global catch data shows there is scope for nutrient yields from
              most of the world's marine fisheries to be enhanced through
              nutrient-sensitive fisheries management. With nutrient composition
              data now widely available, we expect our mMNY framework to
              motivate development of nutrient-based reference points in
              specific contexts, such as data-limited fisheries. Managing for
              mMNY alongside policies that promote access to fish could help
              close nutrient gaps for coastal populations, maximising the

               be achieved through broader social policy. An analysis of global
               landings data shows that average fishing wages in 36\%?67\% of
               countries, home to 69\%?95\% of fishers worldwide, are likely
               below their nationally determined minimum living wage (which
               accounts for costs of food, shelter, clothing, health and
               education). Furthermore, even if all fisheries in every country

               Yield, a common sustainability target, average incomes of fishers

               governors cannot limit themselves to a sectoral perspective.

               select the model with the greatest plausibility. Additionally,
               the interannual growth performance (φ′) variation was described.
               Body mass allometry was established from the relationship between
               total body mass (TM; g) and standard length. The sardine samples
               ranged in size from 114 to 226 mm SL and in weight from 20 to 192

               that the LM model fit the original data better (WAICi ~35\%).
               When models were fitted to data bolstered with simulated values,
               the VBM model obtained the greatest weight (WAICi = 60.9\%), but

               that the Pacific sardine growth pattern was best described by the
               VBM model, which appears to be more robust against biased data.
               The φ′ showed interannual variation (2.13–2.51), with an average
               of φ′ = 2.25. An apparent inverse relationship was observed
               between φ′ and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) or the Pacific

              waters have historically been utilized by large foreign trawlers,
              creating small ripple effects and jobs in Mauritania. However, in
              2012, Mauritanian authorities introduced new restrictive access
              conditions; a 20 nautical mile limit and an obligation to land
              fish caught in this area in Mauritania, so as the national fishing
              industry to play a more important role. This resulted in
              significant changes to vessel fishing strategies and distribution
              channels. For instance, EU vessels that had supplied markets in
              the Gulf of Guinea, providing a low-cost source of protein to
              populations, were now unable to exploit the important sardinella
              resources that migrate along the coast for such purposes. Instead,
              these resources are now harvested by Turkish coastal vessels,
              supplying a very recent large fishmeal and oil industry based in
              Mauritania. Large quantities of small pelagics have thus been
              redirected from being valuable food products to creating fishmeal
              aimed at non-human uses. Moreover, this change has put the small
              pelagics stocks under pressure and most species are currently
              overexploited. Mauritania, under its current 2021–25 policy, is
              presently implementing measures to develop a fish processing
              industry aimed at human consumption, to which European vessels can
              supply fish. Yet, further improvements are still required in the

               migrant fishers to the supply of fishmeal factories in Senegal,
               The Gambia and Mauritania. The method consisted first of
               identifying migrant fishers and then quantifying the volumes of
               small pelagic fish they catch in the three countries studied.
               Then, an interview guide was submitted to more than 250 actors
               (migrant fishers and fishmongers) met in Banjul and Serrekunda in
               the Gambia, in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou in Mauritania, and in
               the fishing, centers located on the small Senegalese coast. These
               individual and collective interviews made it possible to estimate
               and determine the share of migrant fishers’ catches allocated to
               the fishmeal industry. Overall, the four groups of migrant
               fishers (3 Senegalese and 1 Guinean) identified in Mauritania and
               The Gambia catch on average more than 305,000 tonnes of pelagic
               fish per year over the period 2015 - 2018. Analysis of the
               marketing of their catches shows that almost 63\% of the 305,000
               tonnes, i.e. 192,000 tonnes of pelagic fish, are destined to
               supply the fishmeal factories of the three countries studied,
               while only 113,000 tonnes are distributed on the national
               consumer markets (fresh and artisanal processed). Of the 192,000
               tonnes destined for fishmeal factories, two-thirds are sent to
               Mauritanian factories, with Senegal and The Gambia sharing the
               remaining third. Thus, important collaborations have been
               established in recent years between migrant fishers and the
               fishmeal industries. Indeed, the fishmeal industries improve the
               operating accounts of migrant fishers by ensuring the sale of
               their catches at more remunerative prices than on the local
               market at the micro level. However, when analyzed on a large
               scale, fishmeal industries exert a real pressure on the
               nutritional security of West African countries, as pelagic fish
               are the main source of animal protein in Senegal and The Gambia
               and have been over exploited in recent years. In addition, they
               prevent access to artisanal processing of their raw material. All
               these elements raise the question of the urgency of regulating
               migrant fishers catches on a regional scale and drastically
               reducing the share allocated to fishmeal processing in favor of
               local consumption.",

              situated in the northern port of Nouadhibou. After a slow start in
              2005–2010, the industry showed a strong development after 2010 as
              the result of high prices for fishmeal and oil. Catches of small

              240,000t in 2014. Because new factories were still being built by
              the end of 2014, a further expansion of the catches used for
              fishmeal is expected. Data are presented on the species
              composition of the catches for fishmeal, and the length

              sardinella (Sardinella aurita) off northwest Africa, a key species
              for regional food security. Our approach focused on the processes
              responsible for seasonal migrations, spatio-temporal
              size-structure, and interannual biomass fluctuations. Emergence of
              preferred habitat resulted from interactions between natal homing
              behavior and environmental variability that impacts early life
              stages. Exploration of the environment by the fishes was
              determined by swimming capabilities, mesoscale to regional habitat
              structure, and horizontal currents. Fish spatio-temporal abundance
              variability emerged from a complex combination of distinct
              life-history traits. An alongshore gradient in fish size
              distributions is reported and validated by in situ measurements.
              New insights into population structure are provided, within an
              area where the species is abundant year-round (Mauritania) and
              with latitudinal migrations of variable (300–1200 km) amplitude.

              fish recruitment over the Sahara Bank driven by variability in

              Africa. More robust stock assessments are now possible because of
              improved sampling in Mauritania and Senegal. Round sardinella (S.
              aurita), which has a wider distribution than flat sardinella (S.
              maderensis), is the most important species targeted by the
              different artisanal and industrial fleets. The industrial fleet is
              located beyond 13 miles from the coast, taking mainly adults. The
              average size in the offshore fishery, although it has decreased,
              remains above 26 cm. The species is also exploited by an artisanal
              fleet using small purse seiners. Two types of assessment model
              were applied: a production model and size-based model. The
              abundance indices were consistent, and showed a continuous
              decline, increasing in rate in recent years. The Just Another
              Bayesian Biomass Assessment (JABBA) model (applied for the first
              time) appeared to be appropriate for the abundance indices (Root
              Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 18.3–19.2 \% for the two models). The
              results of the two models are consistent in showing increasing
              fishing mortality and declining biomass for both stocks over the
              time series. According to the JABBA model, the situation for the
              round sardinella stock is now critical (biomass at approximately 5
              \% of unexploited biomass (B0) and 10 \% of biomass capable of
              producing maximum sustainable yields (Bmsy), with fishing
              mortality 2.5 times above Fmsy), and the flat sardinella is also
              overfished and suffering massive overfishing (B estimated at 18
              \%B0 and 25 \%Bmsy, with fishing mortality more than 11 times
              above Fmsy). The results of the Length-based Bayesian Biomass
              (LBB) model are much more optimistic. It still concludes that both
              stocks are suffering overfishing (round sardinella F at ∼1.4 times
              Fmsy proxy, flat sardinella ∼2.2 times Fmsy proxy), but estimates
              that only the flat sardinella is overfished (B 28\%B0 and 80
              \%Bmsy), while the round sardinella stock is not overfished (B 40
              \%B0 and 120 \%Bmsy). However, these results are not consistent
              with the abundance index from acoustic surveys (used in the JABBA
              model) and overall are thought to be less robust. Signs of heavy
              exploitation have been observed for round sardinella for several
              years. This situation has been exacerbated since the arrival in
              late 2016 in the Mauritanian zone of efficient semi-industrial
              purse seiners targeting small pelagics. The various indirect
              assessment models used show a difficult stock situation for the
              round sardinella, on which many fishing communities in the area
              depend. Abundance indices from acoustic survey confirm the state
              of overexploitation of this resource. This situation has directed
              effort towards the flat sardinella, which is characterized by a
              more coastal distribution and limited migration. This species has
              been showing signs of overexploitation since 2019. We highlight
              this result for flat sardinella, which was previously not thought
              to be overexploited, and propose that managers should also
              consider how the estimated maximum sustainable catch and fishing
              mortality can be appropriately distributed between the different
              fleets in different countries, to ensure that future industry
              planning in the countries of the region is compatible with the
              sustainability of these critical stocks. This is a very complex
              task, as it involves not only discussions between neighboring
              countries, but also difficult decisions within countries about the
              economic and socio-economic importance of different fisheries
              sectors. It is essential that these reflections start immediately.",

  abstract = "Natural resources often exhibit large interannual fluctuations in
              productivity driven by shifting environmental conditions, and this
              translates to high variability in the revenue resource users earn.
              However, users can dampen this variability by harvesting a
              portfolio of resources. In the context of fisheries, this means
              targeting multiple populations, though the ability to actually
              build diverse fishing portfolios is often constrained by the costs
              and availability of fishing permits. These constraints are
              generally intended to prevent overcapitalization of the fleet and
              ensure populations are fished sustainably. As linked human-natural
              systems, both ecological and fishing dynamics influence the
              specific advantages and disadvantages of increasing the diversity
              of fishing portfolios. Specifically, a portfolio of synchronous
              populations with similar responses to environmental drivers should
              reduce revenue variability less than a portfolio of asynchronous
              populations with opposite responses. We built a bioeconomic model
              based on the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), Chinook
              salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and groundfish fisheries in the
              California Current, and used it to explore the influence of
              population synchrony and permit access on income patterns. As
              expected, synchronous populations reduced revenue variability less
              than asynchronous populations, but only for portfolios including
              crab and salmon. Synchrony with the longer-lived groundfish
              population was not important because environmentally driven
              changes in groundfish recruitment were mediated by growth and
              natural mortality over the full population age structure, and
              overall biomass was relatively stable across years. Thus, building
              a portfolio of diverse life histories can buffer against the
              impacts of poor environmental conditions over short time scales.
              Increasing access to all permits generally led to increased
              revenue stability and decreased inequality of the fleet, but also
              resulted in less revenue earned by an individual from a given
              portfolio because more vessels shared the available biomass. This
              means managers are faced with a trade-off between the average
              revenue individuals earn and the risk those individuals accept.
              These results illustrate the importance of considering connections
              between social and ecological dynamics when evaluating management
              options that constrain or facilitate fishers' ability to diversify
              their fishing.",

              data collected from interviews and workshops in four commercial

              coastline, we ask what barriers and enablers of climate adaptation

              socio-ecological system they are emerging. Thematic analysis
              identified a variety of barriers and enablers of adaptation, of
              which many were shared across communities, while others were
              unique to particular localities. Barriers included fisheries
              specialisation and dependency, overcapitalisation, working

               within the fisheries sector that may arise because of a failure
               to account for key features of wild-caught fisheries and that can
               be addressed by an expanded scope. These market failures include
               multiple species caught together, multiple fisheries targeting
               the same stock, and other ecological and socioeconomic
               interconnections within ecosystems. We also examine market
               failures that may arise when external factors such as climate
               change and species invasions are not considered in fisheries
               management policy or if policies do not consider multisector use
               of seascapes, linkages between water pollution and fisheries, and
               market failures that cut across fisheries and nonfishery sectors

              critical aspects of predicting and rapidly assessing community
              vulnerability to extreme events. We apply network analysis to
              evaluate the impact of a climate shock-an unprecedented marine
              heatwave-on patterns of resource use in California fishing
              communities, which were severely affected through closures of the
              Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified
              flows of users between fishery resources during the closures.
              These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of
              resource use and were associated with three strategies used by
              fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures:
              temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the
              Dungeness crab fishery into other fisheries, and spatial shifts in

               fishers with a diversified catch across multiple species may
               experience benefits such as increased revenue and reduced
               variability in revenue. However, fishers can only increase the
               species diversity of their catch if they own fishing permits that
               allow multiple species to be targeted, or if they own multiple
               single-species permits. Individuals holding a single permit can
               only increase catch diversity within the confines of their permit
               (e.g. by fishing longer or over a broader spatial area). Using a
               large dataset of individual salmon fishers in Alaska, we build a
               Bayesian variance function regression model to understand how
               diversification impacts revenue and revenue variability, and how
               these effects have evolved since the 1970s. Applying these models
               to six salmon fisheries that encompass a broad geographic range
               and a variety of harvesting methods and species, we find that the
               majority of these fisheries have experienced reduced catch
               diversity through time and increasing benefits of specialization
               on mean individual revenues. One factor that has been
               hypothesized to reduce catch diversity in salmon fisheries is
               large-scale hatchery production. While our results suggest
               negative correlations between hatchery returns and catch
               diversity for some fisheries, we find little evidence for a
               change in variability of annual catches associated with increased
               hatchery production. Synthesis and applications. Despite general
               trends towards more specialization among commercial fishers in
               Alaska, and more fishers exclusively targeting salmon, we find
               that catching fewer species can have positive effects on revenue.
               With increasing specialization, it is important to understand how
               individuals buffer against risk, as well as any barriers that
               prevent diversification. In addition to being affected by
               environmental variability, fishers are also affected by economic
               factors including demand and prices offered by processors.
               Life-history variation in the species targeted may also play a
               role. Individuals participating in Alaskan fisheries with high
               contributions of pink salmon ? which have the shortest life

              linear decrease was observed in the condition each year.
              Difference in condition from the onset to end of winter varied
              between 10\% and 20\%. Overall however, condition displayed an

              increasing trend indicates that condition may be dependent on the

              condition of anchovies and the spawning stock biomass supports the
              same view and points out that particularly in winter when food

               capelin (Mallotus villosus) stock. However, since the management
               is based on a target escapement strategy, and most capelin die
               after spawning, viewed in retrospect, there is hardly any
               possibility of checking whether the forecast underpinning the
               quota was actually realistic. The forecast using Captool for the
               period from 1 October up to capelin spawning time at 1 April
               relies on a forecast of cod abundance during this period. This
               estimate of cod abundance is, in turn, based on a cod assessment
               from the previous spring. By rerunning the Captool model, where
               the cod forecast is replaced with the actual amount of cod from
               the cod assessment model run later in time, we show that
               considerably smaller annual quotas would have been advised if the
               true amount of cod had been known when the capelin quota was set.
               We discuss this fact in light of the present knowledge about
               recruitment success of capelin during the period. Our conclusion
               is that either the acoustic stock size estimates of capelin have
               been consistently underestimating the true stock size, the
               predation model overestimates the natural mortality of capelin
               during winter, the minimum spawning stock size considered
               necessary to uphold normal recruitment (Blim) built into the
               harvest control rule is higher than needed to secure good
               recruitment, or a combination of these.",

              to variations in environmental factors and interactions between
              stocks/species, including marine mammals, are experienced for most
              stocks. During the past 3–4 decades several of the stocks have
              suffered from overfishing leading to substantially reduced yields
              in the 1970s and 1980s. In recent years yields of herring, cod and
              haddock have increased mainly because of more appropriate

              fisheries management measures in the area have included both total

               them. Thousands of published papers make it very clear that fish
               are on the move, alterations in productivity are occurring, and
               natural and human ecosystems are responding to climate

               attention to the implications of such regime shifts for domestic
               fisheries, the issue has received little attention in the context
               of international fishery management. This paper presents evidence
               for the significance of climatic regime shifts, and draws upon
               the recent history of conflict between Canada and the United
               States over Pacific salmon management to illustrate the dangers
               that unpredicted, unanticipated environmental regime shifts pose
               for efforts to maintain international cooperation. This suggests
               a need for greater attention to this issue. Fishery agreements
               can be made more resilient to the impacts of such environmental
               changes by explicitly building in flexibility ? for example, by
               allowing the use of side payments. In addition, pre-agreements on

               developing common scientific understandings, can help to prevent
               destructive conflicts. Finally, the literature employing game
               theoretic shared-fishery models could be further developed to
               focus on providing practical guidance for maintaining cooperation

              Previous studies based on mechanistic size-based food web models
              have found that bottom-up processes are important drivers of
              size-structure and fisheries yield in changing climates. However,
              we know less about the joint effects of 'bottom-up' and
              physiological effects of temperature; how do temperature effects
              propagate from individual-level physiology through food webs and
              alter the size-structure of exploited species in a community?
              Here, we assess how a species-resolved size-based food web is
              affected by warming through both these pathways and by
              exploitation. We parameterize a dynamic size spectrum food web
              model inspired by the offshore Baltic Sea food web, and
              investigate how individual growth rates, size-structure, and
              relative abundances of species and yields are affected by warming.
              The magnitude of warming is based on projections by the regional
              coupled model system RCA4-NEMO and the RCP 8.5 emission scenario,
              and we evaluate different scenarios of temperature dependence on
              fish physiology and resource productivity. When accounting for
              temperature-effects on physiology in addition to on basal
              productivity, projected size-at-age in 2050 increases on average
              for all fish species, mainly for young fish, compared to scenarios
              without warming. In contrast, size-at-age decreases when
              temperature affects resource dynamics only, and the decline is
              largest for young fish. Faster growth rates due to warming,
              however, do not always translate to larger yields, as lower
              resource carrying capacities with increasing temperature tend to
              result in decline in the abundance of larger fish and hence
              spawning stock biomass. These results suggest that to understand
              how global warming affects the size structure of fish communities,
              both direct metabolic effects and indirect effects of temperature
              via basal resources must be accounted for.",

              may be caused by physiological constraints associated with
              respiration, life-history responses to faster growth and
              concomitant earlier age at maturity, and interactive effects of
              fishing and climate change on evolution. Here, using a
              phylogenetically broad dataset of 100 marine species, we explore
              how natural mortality might respond to a 10\% reduction in
              asymptotic length (L∞). We find that this decrease in size
              (predicted to be associated with a 1 °C ocean temperature
              increase) is likely to exacerbate natural mortality (M) for most
              marine fishes, albeit not all, on Canada’s Scotian Shelf. Across
              all bony fishes (Actinopterygii), the median proportional increase

              to managing these industries is identifying how regulatory actions

              and, by extension, the economic stability and the sustainable use
              of natural resources. In commercial fisheries, communities and
              vessels fishing a greater diversity of species have less revenue
              variability than those fishing fewer species. However, it is
              unclear whether these benefits extend to the actions of individual
              fishers and how year-to-year changes in diversification affect
              revenue and revenue variability. Here, we evaluate two axes by
              which fishers in Alaska can diversify fishing activities. We show
              that, despite increasing specialization over the last 30 years,
              fishing a set of permits with higher species diversity reduces
              individual revenue variability, and fishing an additional permit
              is associated with higher revenue and lower variability. However,
              increasing species diversity within the constraints of existing

              (87\% probability) associated with increased revenue uncertainty
              the following year. Our results demonstrate that the most
              effective option for individuals to decrease revenue variability
              is to participate in additional or more diverse fisheries.
              However, this option is expensive, often limited by regulations
              such as catch share programs, and consequently unavailable to many
              individuals. With increasing climatic variability, it will be
              particularly important that individuals relying on natural

              Engraulis spp. have been observed in the productive coastal waters
              of the North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Eastern Pacific and
              the South-Eastern Atlantic. In each of these systems, the two
              genera fluctuate out of phase with each other. The subdominant
              genus may initiate a recovery while the other species is still
              abundant, so population growth is not necessarily a response to a
              vacant niche. Rather, it appears to be triggered by formation of
              one or a few powerful year-classes. At high population
              levels,quality of sardine and their eggs decreased in Japan,
              leading to decreased production and survival of eggs, poor
              yearclasses and stock collapse. Excessive fishing of strong
              year-classes early in the recovery stage may prevent a species
              from assuming dominance, so influencing the natural succession of
              species. This may greatly alter the structure andfunctioning of an
              ecosystem. For example, a mesopelagic forage fish may replace an
              epipelagic one, with severe repercussions for predators that can
              only feed in the upper ocean, e.g. some seabirds. Biological
              factors also may influence the succession of forage fish. For
              example, off California, peaks in abundance of predatory species
              such as bonita Sarda, and chub mackerel Scomber, separate those of
              the planktivorous sardine and anchovy. In the Pacific Ocean,
              sardine distribution has change greatly. Compared with its range
              when scarce, a population at a high levelof biomass can extend 1
              000–1 800 miles farther along the coast and 400–2 200 miles
              farther out to sea. In different periods of high biomass, sardine
              did not always have the same distribution. In the 1930s and 1940s,
              near simultaneous fluctuations of sardine in the North-Western and
              North-Eastern Pacific were in phase. In the 1980s and
              1990s,sardine in the North-Western and South-Eastern Pacific were
              fluctuating in phase. However, along the west coast of North
              America, sardine started their most recent increase later than in
              other regions of the Pacific Ocean. This increase is continuing,
              whereas sardine populations in the North-Western and South-Eastern
              Pacific have decreased both in catch and geographic distribution
              since the late 1980s. Therefore, the North-Eastern Pacific has
              moved out of phase with other major Pacific sardine populations.
              This may be because abundance of sardine in the CaliforniaCurrent
              has not yet reached a level at which density-dependent effects
              exert a major influence. Sardine and anchovy in the South-Eastern
              Atlantic have been out of phase with populations in the Pacific
              Ocean, especially those off Peru and Chile. Over the last 300
              years, episodic fisheries for Bohuslän herring Clupea harengus in
              Sweden coincide with periodsof high anchovy abundance off
              California. Near simultaneous fluctuations of fish stocks in
              widely separated regions support the view that they are sometimes
              influenced by climate operating at a global scale. Changes of the
              gyre-scale circulation seem to be major factors in the decadal
              climate. In Australia, sardine have a wide range, but the less
              productive waters support a much lower biomass than is found in
              the other four systems. Engraulis occur in some systems from which
              Sardinops are absent, for example, Brazil, where they and
              Sardinella are segregated verticallyin the water column.",

               The breakpoint analysis revealed that the former criterion

              identifying stock recruit relationships (SRR) to 52 forage fish
              stocks: a time-invariant Ricker model and two time-varying methods
              (dynamic linear models and regime-based models). A positive
              relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment existed for
              28 stocks, with 14 of those being best fit by a Ricker curve.
              Time-varying models were preferred for 26 stocks over a
              time-invariant Ricker curve. We also showed through simulation
              that spurious, yet significant stock-recruit relationships can be
              generated if recruitment was environmentally driven, the lag
              between recruitment and spawning biomass was small, and
              autocorrelation in recruitment was high—a combination of
              characteristics that many forage fish stocks display. Based on our

              in the abundance and distribution of fishery resources threaten
              international cooperation. This article examines the breakdown in
              resource cooperation for the northeast Atlantic mackerel fishery
              where, for over a decade, Coastal States have failed to reach an
              agreement on the management of the stock after a climate-induced
              shift in the stock’s distribution. Why did the management regime
              fail? And what are lessons learnt for such regimes more generally?
              This article sheds light on the interplay between a relatively
              weak international regime, domestic interests related to the
              importance of the national fishing industry and a breakdown in the
              common principles – fisheries science – that international
              cooperation is based on. The limited flexibility in the
              negotiating position of the various states – and thus, the regime
              at large – can be ascribed to a combination of strong domestic
              industry influence on negotiating positions, and a disagreement
              over the appropriate methods to measure stock biomass in tandem
              with unclear allocation principles. Strengthening existing
              mechanisms to cooperatively manage shared stocks between Coastal
              States will be important to avoid such disputes in the future.
              However, states are weary of relinquishing decision-making powers.
              Therefore, starting with an agreement on the fundamentals, namely
              the science that underpins diverging claims, could be a first step
              towards a long-term solution for the northeast Atlantic mackerel.",

              herrings, sardines, and anchovies-are important prey species in
              marine ecosystems and also support large commercial fisheries. In
              many parts of the world, forage fish fisheries are managed using
              precautionary principles that target catch limits below the
              maximum sustainable yield. However, there are increasing calls to
              further limit forage fish catch to safeguard their fish, seabird,
              and marine mammal predators. The effectiveness of these
              extra-precautionary regulations, which assume that increasing prey
              abundance increases predator productivity, are under debate. In
              this study, we used prey-linked population models to measure the
              influence of forage fish abundance on the population growth rates
              of 45 marine predator populations representing 32 fish, seabird,
              and mammal species from 5 regions around the world. We used
              simulated data to confirm the ability of the statistical model to
              accurately detect prey influences under varying levels of
              influence strength and process variability. Our results indicate
              that predator productivity was rarely influenced by the abundance
              of their forage fish prey. Only 6 predator populations (13\% of
              the total) were positively influenced by increasing prey abundance
              and the model exhibited high power to detect prey influences when
              they existed. These results suggest that additional limitation of
              forage fish harvest to levels well below sustainable yields would

              exploitation of fish resources, making management highly complex.
              Such complexity is compounded by the insufficient knowledge of

              special emphasis on the state of the fishing as reported by
              government agencies, and suggests how this diagnosis changes with

  abstract  = "The ICES Working Group on Southern horse mackerel, anchovy and
               sardine (WGHANSA) assessed the status of anchovy in Atlantic
               Iberian waters (ane.27.9a; western and southern components) and
               horse mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters (hom.27.9a) in the May
               meeting. The status of anchovy in Bay of Biscay (ane.27.8),
               sardine in southern Celtic Seas and the English Channel
               (pil.27.7), sardine in Bay of Biscay (pil.27.8abd), sardine in
               Cantabrian Sea and Atlantic Iberian waters (pil.27.8c9a) and jack
               mackerel in Subdivision 10.a.2 (Azores grounds) (jaa.27.10a2) was
               assessed in the November meeting. The stock of anchovy in Bay of
               Biscay (ane.27.8) has been above Blim since the reopening of the
               fishery in 2010. SSB in 2022 has been estimated as the third
               highest of the historical series. Recruitment (age 1 biomass at
               the beginning of the year) in 2023 is estimated above the average
               of the time-series. Harvest rates (catch/SSB) have been stable in
               the last years. The stock of anchovy in Atlantic Iberian waters
               (ane.27.9a) is composed by the western component (distributed in
               areas 9.a North, Central–North, and Central–South) and the
               southern component (distributed in area 9.a South). The advice is
               provided for the two components separately for the management
               calendar from July to June next year. For the western component,
               the index ratio (1-over-2 rule) based on the PELACUS and PELAGO
               surveys shows an 83\% increase of the stock in 2022 compared with
               the mean of the two previous years, and the 80\% uncertainty cap
               is applied. For the southern component, the relative SSB from an
               analytical assessment conducted with GADGET is used as the index
               of stock size development. The index ratio (1-over-2 rule)
               indicates that the relative SSB in 2022 is 71\% lower than in the
               two previous years. Given that in 2022 the stock component size
               is below Blim, a biomass safeguard has been considered. In the
               last years sardine in the Bay of Biscay (pil.27.8abd) shows a
               decreasing trend in SSB. In 2022 spawning-stock biomass is
               estimated below MSY Btrigger, Bpa and above Blim. Since 2013 the
               fishing mortality has been oscillating above FMSY and Fpa, and
               below Flim. The advice for sardine in southern Celtic Seas and
               the English Channel (pil.27.7) is based on the PELTIC survey
               biomass index in the total area. Due to technical reasons, this
               year the coverage of the survey was incomplete and an estimate of
               the biomass in the total area was obtained by raising the
               estimate from the area covered in 2022 to the total area based on
               historical proportions. The index ratio indicates an increase of
               20\% in 2022 compared with the two previous years. The biomass
               (age 1+) of sardine in Atlantic Iberian waters (pil.27.8c9a) in
               2022 is estimated to be above MSY Btrigger, Bpa and Blim for the
               third consecutive year. Fishing mortality in 2021 is slightly
               above FMSY but is among the lowest of the time-series. ICES
               advice is based on the ICES MSY advice rule. However, the catch
               options explored for 2023 include several harvest control rules
               that were assessed by ICES as precautionary. The SSB of horse
               mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters (hom.27.9a) fluctuated from
               1992 (the beginning of the assessment) to 2013 and afterwards has
               increased continuously to historical maximum values in 2022. In
               2022 SSB is estimated at 1 155 488 tonnes, well above MSY
               Btrigger, Bpa, and Blim. Fishing mortality has been below FMSY
               over the whole time-series, with a decreasing trend in the last
               years. Since 2018, recruitment is considered very uncertain due
               to the lack of the survey index in 2019 and 2020. The jack
               mackerel in Subdivision 10.a.2 (Azores grounds) (jaa.10.a2) is
               classified in category 5 and advice is provided biannually. The
               stock and exploitation status relative to MSY and precautionary
               approach (PA) reference points cannot be assessed. Given that
               there is no ancillary information clearly indicating that the
               current level of exploitation is appropriate for the stock, the
               20\% precautionary buffer was applied to provide advice for 2023
               and 2024.",

               multiple margins of production. Using a combination of analytical
               and simulation methods, we demonstrate how market prices and

               production?the deployment of fishing time over space. We show
               that institutionally driven spatial selection leads to only a

               identified estimates of production possibilities outside of the

               many estimated fisheries production functions suffer from a lack

              processes such as overfishing, globalization, and climate change.
              Enhancing the number of options for human response through
              increased access to marine resources, diverse livelihood
              approaches, and generalist fishing strategies may attenuate the
              negative effects of change and disturbance. My research explores
              the relative importance of diversification strategies for
              achieving resilient small-scale fishing communities and
              cooperatives of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically,
              interview data and long-term catch and economic data were used to
              develop an economic metric of resilience, in addition to income
              diversification indices, for fishing cooperatives. Fishing
              cooperative characteristics and environmental conditions were then
              evaluated as possible predictors of cooperatives’ relative ability
              to diversify. I found that while diversification was important for
              risk mitigation and stabilizing income, the ability of
              cooperatives to specialize during favorable conditions may be
              important for poverty reduction and wealth accumulation. Thus, the
              flexibility to move across fishing strategies given changing
              environmental conditions is important for the adaptive capacity of
              small-scale fishing cooperatives. My findings will contribute to a
              better understanding of the institutional arrangements that
              promote a resilient small-scale fishery, and therefore, will be
              invaluable for practitioners of small-scale fisheries.",

              South). The advice is provided for the two components separately
              for the management calendar from July to June next year. For the
              western component, the index ratio (1-over-2 rule) based on the
              PELACUS and PELAGO surveys showed a 83\% increase of the stock in
              2022 in comparison to the mean of the two previous years, and the
              80\% uncertainty cap was applied. For the southern component, the
              relative SSB from an analytical assessment conducted with GADGET
              was used as the index of stock size development. The index ratio
              (1-over-2 rule) indicated that the relative SSB in 2022 was 71\%
              lower than in the two previous years. Given that in 2022 the stock
              size was below Blim, a biomass safeguard was considered. The SSB
              of horse mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters (hom.27.9a)
              fluctuated from 1992 (the beginning of the assessment) to 2013 and
              afterwards increased continuously to historical maximum values in
              2022. In 2022 SSB is estimated at 1 155 488 tonnes, well above MSY
              Btrigger, Bpa, and Blim. Fishing mortality has been below FMSY
              over the whole time-series, with a decreasing trend in the last
              years. Since 2018, recruitment is considered very uncertain due to

              Wild fish harvesters face high income volatility linked to natural
              variability in fish abundance, changing ocean environments, and
              world market dynamics. Past research has shown that owning
              additional permits reduces risk but at considerable cost, leaving
              such adaptation strategies unattainable for many harvesters. This
              study conducted a survey with Gulf of Alaska commercial salmon
              permit holders applying a discrete choice experiment to
              investigate the propensity of harvesters to switch target species
              within a given permit and to better understand participation under
              rapid environmental and economic change, increasingly outside

              these factors were of concern to the long-term viability of their

               In Europe's Common Fisheries Policy, the share of the catch of

               allocation key known as ‘Relative Stability’: in each management
               area, member states get the same proportion of the total catch
               each year. That proportion is largely based on catches made by
               those member states in the 1970s. Changes in distribution can,
               therefore, result in a mismatch between quota shares and regional
               abundances within management areas, with potential repercussions
               for the status of fish stocks and the fisheries that depend on

              the variations in growth and selective mortality were related to
              seasonal temperature, food quantity, stock biomass or stock
              harvest rate. In both species, there was a decline in growth
              during age 0 over time and a catch-up growth declined in anchovy.
              Density-dependence had a strong effect on growth in anchovy. In
              both species, there was a systematic selective disappearance of
              individuals with large growth at age-0 within each cohort and
              selection has changed over time to favour individuals with large
              catch-up growth in anchovy. Moreover, diversifying selection
              occurred for growth at age-0 in both species and catch-up growth
              in anchovy. In anchovy, years with high selective disappearance of
              large individuals, high catch-up growth and high diversifying
              selection were those in which the harvest rates were high
              (environmental variables having more limited effect). In sardine,
              the selective disappearance of large individuals was stronger in
              years with low food quantity and the magnitude of selection acting
              on growth was unrelated to this stock’s harvest rate. Though
              fishing exerted strong selection pressure in anchovy, selective
              mortality against large growth still occurred even at low harvest
              rates in both species, suggesting that this might be a natural
              process affecting these small pelagic forage fish species.
              Although anchovy and sardine have a similar trophic position,
              their selection regimes differed due to differences in their stock
              dynamics, environmental sensitivity, and fishing rate. It might
              therefore be hazardous to extrapolate the responses of single
              species to environmental and anthropogenic factors onto others.",

              (Sardina pilchardus) have been decreasing since the early 2000s
              and could severely impact the fishing and seafood industry sector.
              These trends have no apparent link with fishing pressure, although
              the latter has been increasing since the late 2000s. As part of an
              effort to develop suitable assessment and management tools for
              this stock, we investigated the life-history traits of sardine and
              analyze its seasonal and inter-annual variations. Based on 14
              years of morphometric data from both scientific surveys and
              professional samples, we analyzed the variability in sardine body
              condition and its responses to environmental changes. Generalized
              Additive Models revealed an age-sex specific decreasing trend in
              body length over the study period, with most of the variability
              explained by the age class. Linear Mixed Effect Models applied to
              the body condition evidenced its strong seasonality and an age
              class specific decreasing trend. Regardless of age class, maximal
              body condition is reached at the end summer, after the spawning
              and plankton productive periods. Overall, annual trends in body
              condition-at-age showed remarkable coherence, with a significant
              decrease since 2007 for all age classes, suggesting that factors
              influencing body condition operate at population level. The shift
              in sardine body condition towards lower values could be broken
              down into three periods, with a high dependence on surface
              Chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature. However, this study
              highlights that the period supporting the main decrease in body
              condition is characterized by high Chlorophyll-a, the available
              proxy for food, which is counterintuitive. Such a result suggests
              more complex trophic responses involving secondary production,
              with potential shift in the timing of the production and/or the
              quality of the food. At the population level, those changes may
              have a long-term negative effect, with a decrease in body length
              and important changes in phenology (length at first maturity,
              reproductive phenology) and potential consequences on sardine
              population dynamics in the Bay of Biscay.",

              (i) which ecosystem data can be provided by a fisheries survey
              optimised for ecosystem monitoring; and (ii) how to combine/select
              potential indicators to derive useful information on marine
              ecosystem status and dynamics? A suite of 143 potential
              indicators, including spatial indices, representing small pelagic
              fish and their biotic and abiotic environments are presented.
              Indicators were routinely derived from the PELGAS integrated
              ecosystem survey conducted in spring in the Bay of Biscay (BoB).
              The general patterns over time in this suite of 5–16 years,
              non-stationary time series are characterised using a methodology
              based on min–max autocorrelation factors (MAF), to select the most
              continuous indicators within, and across, several ecosystem
              components: hydrology, phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, small
              pelagic fish and megafauna. Potential interactions between
              selected indicators and external forcing variables, including
              climate and fishing, were assessed. The results confirm the
              importance of river discharges, bottom temperature, chlorophyll-a
              and mesozooplankton biomass in the dynamics of the BoB pelagic
              ecosystem. Small pelagic fish species appear to have followed
              distinct trajectories during the last 15 years. A marked decrease
              in anchovy and sardine mean weights at ages 1 and 2 over the last
              15 years was highlighted; potentially caused by density-dependent
              competition. The quasi-absence of significant correlation between
              selected survey indicators and climate and fishing pressure
              proxies suggests a moderate exploitation rate of small pelagic
              fish resources, and confirms the so far limited effects of
              large-scale climate forcing on the BoB pelagic ecosystem.

              seas. Although the underlying processes are still not well
              understood, recent studies point to a bottom-up control. In order
              to better understand how the environment impacts the main
              individual life history traits, which themselves control the
              dynamic of the population, we developed a comparative approach
              between two species, European anchovy and sardine, and across
              three regions of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea: the
              English Channel in the north, to the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of
              Lion in the south. We developed a bioenergetic modeling framework
              based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB). Our DEB models
              were forced using two different representations of the lower
              trophic levels, POLCOMS-ERSEM and SEAPODYM models. Our models were
              calibrated for the Bay of Biscay and then projected on to the
              other regions, over the early 2000s (period with bigger fish) and
              the early 2010s (period with smaller fish). The environment alone,
              temperature and zooplankton, explained a significant part of the
              observed regional differences in growth. However, the temporal
              trends simulated by the lower trophic levels models, when
              transcribed through bioenergetics, could not explain the strong
              decrease in length and weight that occurred in the Bay of Biscay
              (-30 \% in weight for anchovy and −20 \% for sardine) and in the
              Gulf of Lion (-30 \% for anchovy and −50 \% for sardine). Through
              a scenario approach, we estimated that a decrease in zooplankton
              quality could be a significant driver of the observed decrease in
              size both in the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lion (decrease
              in assimilable energy of 4 to 5 \% and 15 to 17 \% in the Bay of
              Biscay and the Gulf of Lion, respectively). For such a decrease in
              size, a zooplankton biomass of the same quality should have been
              reduced by between 17 and 31 \% in the Bay of Biscay over a 10- to
              15-year period, while no biologically realistic estimations were
              obtained for the Gulf of Lion. The validity of these proposed

              alternative explanations.",

              Mis-specifying catchability can lead to inaccurate estimation of
              model parameters and bias in the determination of stock status.
              The Gulf of Mexico has one of the largest seasonal occurrences of
              hypoxia in the world and it overlaps in time and space with the
              Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus fishery, potentially leading to
              temporal and spatial patterns in stock distribution and thus
              catchability. These patterns are not currently modeled in the Gulf
              menhaden stock assessment. To better understand the implications
              of spatial and temporal patterns in catchability due to hypoxia,
              we constructed an operating model of Gulf menhaden fishery
              dynamics under various assumptions of spatial coverages and
              temporal patterns, and used the output from the operating model as
              input into estimation models with alternative approaches on
              modeling catchability. Under the most extreme assumptions about
              the spatial coverage and magnitude of variation in catchability,
              median absolute error in estimates of fishing mortality and
              spawning stock reference points (F30\% and S30\%) was 73\% and
              29\%, respectively, and median absolute error in estimates of
              fishing mortality and spawning stock based stock status was 23\%
              and 79\%, supporting the notion that errors in catchability are
              important. Under more reasonable assumptions, median absolute
              error declined to 20\% and 2.9\% for F30\% and S30\%,
              respectively, and to 3.8\% and 2.4\% for fishing mortality and
              spawning stock-based stock status, respectively. Modeling
              catchability as a random walk further reduced median absolute
              error to 5.0\% for F30\% and 1.4\% for S30\%, but slightly
              increased median absolute error for stock status indicators to
              4.0\% and 3.3\%. Our results show generally that the spatial
              coverage, temporal pattern, and estimation approach of
              catchability affects the influence of mis-specifying catchability;
              and show specifically that the Gulf menhaden stock assessment is
              robust to the effects of hypoxia on catchability if assuming

               this resource was the production of guano. In 1957 the fishery
               for anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) for reduction to meal and oil
               began on a significant scale. Catches rocketed to 8 million tons
               by 1964 making Peru the country with the biggest catch of fish.
               Most of the production (averaging some 2 millions tons of meal)
               is exported, and fish meal is (with copper) one of the two
               biggest earners of foreign exchange in the Peruvian
               economy.Scientific studies of the resource, including collection
               of detailed statistical data of the fishery have been carried out
               from an early stage. Research has been facilitated by the setting
               up of the Instituto del Mar del Peru, with the assistance of UNDP
               and FAO. Studies of the population dynamics of anchoveta have
               shown that by 1965 the stock was being heavily exploited, and
               that under average conditions the sustainable yield was around
               8–10 million tons, being higher when the bird population is
               low.Regulations to manage and conserve the stock include a closed

               beginning of the year when small fish are abundant, and a limit
               to the total catch during a fishing season (September–August).
               However, regulations have not prevented development of great
               excess capacity in vessels and processing plants.During 1972
               there was a severe crisis in the fishery, when there were unusual
               oceanographic conditions and an almost complete recruitment
               failure. Catches in the second half of the year had to be cut to
               nearly nothing. Hopefully the stock is now rebuilding, but these
               events emphasize the need to reduce the excess capacity, so as to
               improve the economic status of the industry and stability of the

              facing overcapacity. As of 2017, approximately half of the 37
              stocks with abundance estimates were either overfished or subject
              to overfishing. In response, in December 2018, the government of
              Japan enacted revisions to the Fisheries Act which was modeled
              partly on the systems used in the United States and the EU.
              Implementing these changes will take time, as lessons learned from
              other countries are incorporated. Over the past 26 years, the
              United States has undergone a similar succession of amendments to
              its fisheries law, yielding a system that has been largely
              successful in reducing overfishing and rebuilding overfished
              fisheries. We compare the Japanese and U.S. approaches to
              fisheries management in four areas that may explain the
              differences in the number of stocks that are overfished: 1)
              overall structure of fisheries management and who is responsible
              for conducting the management, 2) the specificity and goals of
              fisheries laws in each country, 3) the role and independence of
              science in the management process, and 4) the approach to
              scientific and management uncertainty.",

               and sardine share nursery grounds in the Kuroshio–Oyashio
               transitional waters, where the subtropical and subarctic currents
               converge from the south and north, respectively. We found that

               changed the local environment in the nursery grounds to be
               favorable for late larvae and early juveniles of anchovy, but not
               for those of sardine during 1996–2002. Increased temperature
               enhanced growth and survival for anchovy, whereas reduced food
               availability diminished those for sardine. Northward expansion of
               the subtropical waters have been linked with wind-forced anomaly
               of sea-surface height in the central North Pacific. After 1988,
               when anchovy flourished and sardine collapsed in the western

               Growth of Japanese sardine, estimated by using annual rings on

               extremely stunted in the 1980–1987 year-classes. The body length
               at age 3 from February to April in the 1980–1987 year-classes, a
               period when the stock size exceeded 4 million tons, was 180.0 ±
               2.6 mm (mean ± SD), and in the other year-classes was 195.1 ± 7.6

               Trends in the appearance frequency of sea surface temperatures
               (SST) of 12?18 °C during August?September indicated an
               interdecadal reduction in the potential fishing area off the

               both SST and the sea level anomaly along the Kuril?Kamchatka
               Trench off the Hokkaido coast. The localized trends coincided
               with decadal decreases of satellite-based chlorophyll
               concentrations after 2002. Analysis of mesoscale eddies revealed
               that the localized trends were related to clockwise

              Scomber japonicus, and Pacific saury Cololabis saira. The catch
              and biomass of SPF generally showed decadal-scale variability with
              prominent species replacements since the 1900s. The causes of
              species replacements were generally associated with
              climatic/oceanic variability, particularly “regime shifts,” of
              which the 1988/89 regime shift was the most influential since the
              1970s. Variability in the early survival rate is a key factor for
              population fluctuations, and the proposed hypothetical mechanisms
              of recruitment variability are summarized herein. Although
              overfishing during the 1990s and early 2000s prevented the
              recovery of Pacific stocks of sardine and chub mackerel, they have
              been recovering since the mid-2000s owing to strong year classes
              and reduced exploitation rates. The fundamental cause of
              overfishing was derived from a mismatch between investments in
              larger purse seine fleets during the 1980s and poor ocean
              productivity since the 1988/89 regime shift, when dominant SPF
              began to shift from sardine to anchovy. Recommendations for
              fisheries management of SPF around the Japanese Archipelago are
              proposed, considering climate change and naturally and drastically
              changing SPF populations.",

               terms of managing fisheries resources. The first half of this
               book introduces the history and institutional features of capture
               fisheries management in Japan, with 9 case studies from
               sub-arctic to tropical ecosystems, from sedentary to migratory
               species, and from small-scale coastal to offshore industrial
               fisheries. For example, coastal fisheries management is more
               community-based, and local people have the authority and take
               priority in the decision-making process. In contrast, offshore
               fisheries are more industrialized and commercially oriented, and
               the national government plays a major role in their management.
               One of the main challenges in world fisheries is to implement the
               ecosystem approach, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution
               for its implementation. The second half of this book considers
               the advantages and limitations of the Japanese fisheries

               policy measures to bridge the gaps between fisheries management

               globally, yet there is an ongoing debate about the magnitude of
               the impacts of environmental processes and fishing activities on
               target species. We use a nonparametric, nonlinear approach to
               quantify these effects on the Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax)
               in the Gulf of California. We show that the effect of fishing
               pressure and environmental variability are comparable.
               Furthermore, when predicting total catches, the best models
               account for both drivers. By using empirical dynamic programming
               with average environmental conditions, we calculated optimal
               policies to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries. The first
               policy, the equilibrium maximum sustainable yield, suggests that
               the fishery could sustain an annual catch of ∼2.16 × 105 tonnes.
               The second policy with dynamic optimal effort, reveals that the
               effort from 2 to 4 years ago impacts the current maximum
               sustainable effort. Consecutive years of high effort require a
               reduction to let the stock recover. Our work highlights a new
               framework that embraces the complex processes that drive
               fisheries population dynamics yet produces simple and robust
               advice to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries.",

               ecological changes have had a significant impact on its overall
               health. We review the relevant history of the economically
               important fishery based on large Humboldt (jumbo flying) squid
               (Dosidicus gigas) (>50 cm mantle-length and 10 kg body weight)
               that existed in the Guaymas Basin from the 1990′s until 2009,
               when a strong El Niño was accompanied by precocious spawning of
               squid at extremely small size (<30 cm mantle length and 0.1 kg).
               This short-lived phenotype is characteristic of the equatorial
               part of the species range and cannot be profitably fished. This
               phenomenon also occurred in conjunction with the strong 1997–1998
               El Niño. Although rapid recovery of squid size and landings
               occurred after the 1997–1998 event, recovery after 2009–2010 El
               Niño was still incomplete when another strong El Niño occurred in
               2015–2016. This last event has led to fixation of the small
               size-at-maturity phenotype in the Gulf of California — an
               effective poleward migration of the tropical phenotype. We also
               document years between El Niño 2009–2010 and 2015–2016 as being
               characterized by significant subsurface warming, leading to
               decreased productivity and restricted nighttime foraging
               opportunities for squid in the upper water column. These climatic
               trends have likely altered trophic webs throughout the Gulf of
               California, impacting many other taxa, including small pelagic
               fishes that are ecologically vital and commercially harvested in
               large quantities, as well as a suite of larger teleost fishes
               that are targeted by sport fishers. From these disparate data
               sources, collected and collated in coordination with regional
               resource users and environmental monitoring programs, an overall
               pattern emerges of long-term decline across multiple taxa. We
               also present evidence of a significant abatement of subsurface
               warming after 2015 and consider when – or if – the Gulf of
               California will return to a ‘normal’ state like that prior to
               2010. Despite the potential for shifting to a cooler oceanic
               regime, the small phenotype for jumbo squid has persisted until
               present (2022), and the overall trajectory of ecological recovery
               is unclear. Integrated analyses of additional oceanographic and
               biological time-series, fisheries records, and other data will be
               necessary to identify critical processes and trajectories

               Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus), are captured in the Gulf

               other fishes. The sardine fishery within the Gulf has been
               showing signs of overfishing since the early 1990s. To contribute
               to the sustainable management of this fishery, we developed two
               statistical models that use oceanographic conditions and seabird
               breeding and feeding data to predict total fishery catch and
               catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Pacific sardine in the central
               Gulf. Total catch was predicted with an accuracy of 54\% by a

               the clutch size of Heermann's Gulls ( Larus heermanni), and the

               the reproductive success of Heermann's Gulls, and the springtime
               sea surface temperature anomaly in the Gulf region. Our results

               mation can be used to predict in advance the outcome of fishing
               efforts. We propose the use of models of this kind to reduce the

              plummeted from 292,000 t in 1988–89 to 7000 t in 1991–92 and
              1992–93. This caused a serious economic crisis in the local
              fishery fleet and industry, and resulted in the loss of 3000 jobs.
              In 1993–94 the fishery showed signs of recovery as the abundance
              of the Pacific sardine began to recover. The catch improved to
              128,000 t in 1993–94 and further to 215,000 t in 1996–97. In

              sardine of the Gulf of California is determined by the wind
              patterns (upwelling) and the sea surface temperature. The results

              The adjusted pattern explained 78.8\% of the variability of the

               latitude and dimensions, the most important being strong tidal
               mixing, some of it close to deep stratification.
               Three-dimensional numerical model results suggest that tidal
               mixing may be more important than the thermohaline circulation in
               causing the long-term residual circulation, which consists of
               outflow in the upper 200 m and inflow below, plus a
               seasonally-reversing surface layer. The GC is an evaporative
               basin, but in the mean it gains heat through the surface. Lacking
               a sill at the point of connection with the Pacific Ocean (PO),
               the GC is constantly shaken by a wide spectrum of signals coming
               from the PO, including tides, subinertial trapped waves of
               various frequencies and El Niño. The seasonal dynamics and
               thermodynamics of the GC are dominated by the PO, not by local
               wind or buoyancy flux. Local processes are important at shorter
               time scales and in altering the thermohaline characteristics of
               the upper-layer waters. Tidal currents generate internal tides,
               packets of solitons, and sea surface temperature fronts from
               which jets may form. Coastal upwelling also seems to generate
               jets that separate from capes, especially on the mainland coast.
               The mesoscale off-shore circulation in the GC consists of a
               series of basin-wide geostrophic gyres that reach below 1000 m;
               their effect on the mean and seasonal circulation and
               thermodynamics of the GC remains to be studied. During summer,
               the currents in the mainland continental shelf are due to coastal
               trapped waves, while during winter they are wind-driven. The most
               important interannual anomalies in the GC are due to El Niño.",

              large number of landing sites, multi-species catches and low
              CPUEs. Fish are commercialised mainly fresh and the prices are
              relatively high. These factors make it difficult and expensive to
              get extensive and reliable data time series and to get biological
              samples. Most of the fish caught in the Mediterranean are the
              recruits (0-1 year old) of the main target species. Since the
              recruitment is much more uncertain than the abundance of the adult
              stages, the assessments are also more uncertain. Furthermore, no
              TAC or adaptive management is in place, so the administrations do
              not require monitoring in order to manage the fisheries. The
              continental shelf is narrow (with some exceptions) and there are
              few stocks shared between two or more countries. Consequently, the
              international management structures have not been sufficiently
              enforced, and until recently no regular assessments were made by
              international working groups. These characteristics have led to a

               Detailed studies on the spatial distribution and habitat
               selection of such species have been performed in different areas
               of the world, highlighting the importance of environmental
               processes. The present study analyzes the spatial distribution of
               anchovy and sardine in the Tyrrhenian Sea in relation to
               environmental heterogeneity. Four acoustic surveys were carried
               out in this area in the period 2009–2014. Analysis of the
               environmental dataset permitted identification, in two specific
               areas, of a pattern of variables driving enrichment processes and
               impacting on the habitat suitability of the two species. In the
               northern and central parts of the study area, both anchovy and
               sardine showed a marked preference for shallower areas
               characterized by lower salinity. In these areas, PCA results on
               an environmental dataset highlighted a strong link between
               primary production, particulate organic carbon, distance from the
               mouth of the river, salinity and depth. A less clear picture was
               obtained for the southern part of the Tyrrhenian sea,
               characterized by a narrow continental shelf, moderately complex
               coastline morphology and the presence of very small rivers. Most
               of the anchovy biomass was found to be located in enclosed areas
               (gulfs) under the influence of relatively small rivers. This
               finding, taking into account that the surveys were carried out
               during the anchovy spawning period, highlights for such species a
               positive effect of the interaction between coastal morphology and
               riverine input, probably favoring food supply and retention of

               which maximize reproductive success under environmental
               fluctuations. Biological data were collected from purse seine and
               mid-water pelagic trawl commercial catches landed in Sciacca
               (Sicily) over 6 yr (1997–2002) at fortnightly intervals,
               analysing a total of 84 581 individuals. No inter-annual changes
               in length at first reproduction were observed, with a mean pooled
               value of 11.26 cm for both sexes being found. Spawning intensity,
               indicated by gonadosomatic index, condition factor and
               length–weight relationships, seem to be governed by food
               availability prior to spawning. Anchovy reproductive investment
               was limited by the area's low primary production. There was a

               warming marks the onset of a period of high water stability in

               low water stability. The relationship between reproductive cycle
               and temperature is therefore probably a reproductive strategy
               having evolved to ensure that spawning takes place during the
               period of the year when water column stability is higher,

               and have been of considerable conservation concern because of
               their intermediate position in aquatic food webs, often being a
               dominant dietary component of marine predators. This paper
               provides an overview of trends in abundance and fishing pressure
               on small pelagic fish stocks from single-species scientific
               assessments that constitute 60\% of global small pelagic catch.
               While most individual stocks have exhibited wide variability in
               abundance (typical of small pelagics compared with other fish
               taxa), across stocks there has been remarkable stability in
               average fishing pressure and biomass since 1970. On average,
               since 1970, the biomass of assessed small pelagic stocks is
               estimated to have been slightly above the biomass that would
               produce maximum sustainable yield, but estimation of this
               quantity for highly fluctuating stocks is quite uncertain. There
               were significant differences among assessed regions, with the
               Mediterranean and Black Sea of greatest concern for high and
               growing fishing pressure. The 40\% of global small pelagic fish
               catch not covered by single-species quantitative stock
               assessments since 1970 comes largely from Asia, where catches
               have continued to increase. At regional levels, the average
               abundance of assessed small pelagic fish is largely unrelated to
               average fishing pressure, which we argue results both from the
               portfolio effect, where numerous stocks fluctuate with little
               correlation in abundance, and from the short life span of small
               pelagics coupled with recruitment largely independent of spawning
               abundance.",

              uncertainties associated with the impact of climate change on the
              domestic and imported seafood supply. First, we conduct a
              literature review to identify the climate risk for sea food
              security, and then, we analyse the domestic production of both the
              marine fishing catch and aquaculture. This study also examines the
              critical problems of the imported seafood supply and applies a
              comparative analysis of impact type and differences in the top 10
              seafood import countries to organize adaptation strategies to
              climate change. Moreover, due to the type of climate impact and
              the differences between long-term climate impact and extreme
              climate impact, we collect and compile the existing climate
              adaptation strategies of fishery production, seafood importing,
              and the demand and supply of seafood in Taiwan. Finally, we
              perform a comparative analysis to seek any deficiencies in the
              existing climate adaptation strategies and offer new adaptation
              guidelines based on the existing climate adaptation strategies.
              The results show that Taiwan’s major adaptation strategies have
              been precautionary mitigation measures. In terms of resilience
              management, only the buffer stock scheme plan and the
              stabilization funds method are selected for some specific species
              to mitigate the short-term fluctuation in both yield and price for
              imported domestic seafood. However, we will confront uncertainties
              stemming from global climate change in the future; the existing
              climate adaptation strategies of Taiwan are still not sufficient
              to respond to climate impacts. For example, the climate change
              early warning system is still very inadequate, the existing
              scientific knowledge is insufficient, and the current adaptation
              strategies are insufficient for resolving the fluctuations in the
              market mechanism of seafood. According to the principles of risk
              management, the adaptation strategies recommended in this study
              can be differentiated into two categories: precautionary
              mitigation measures can be used to adapt to domestic production
              and uncertainties; such measures include avoidance, transfer, and
              reduction to prevent the frequency and consequences of climate
              change for building a resilient fisheries sector. Moreover,
              resilience management (e.g., risk retention) can be used to
              respond to uncertainties in supply for adjusting production and
              mitigating the risks of climate change.",

              to their capacities (or failures) to manage production and market

              structure, evidence of crisis and adaptability of response.
              Results revealed three modes of adaptation amongst POs
              (anticipatory, maladaptation and reactive adaptation) and
              identified key reasons explaining different degrees of
              adaptability in POs: 1) prejudiced market regime and 2) prevalence
              of the sardine fishery, as contextual conditions; 3) evidence of
              market crisis; 4) leadership, 5) trust and 6) perception of

              PO contribution to sustainable fisheries management, but it is not
              a panacea. Official market regime and the internal structure of
              POs need to change as they sustain overfishing as well as fisher
              vulnerability and self-interest. The adaptive strategies evident

               coupled social-ecological systems?including fisheries?that can
               withstand or adapt to climate stressors. Although resilience
               theory identifies system attributes that supposedly confer
               resilience, these attributes have rarely been clearly defined,
               mechanistically explained, nor tested and applied to inform
               fisheries governance. Here, we develop and apply a comprehensive
               resilience framework to examine fishery systems across (a)
               ecological, (b) socio-economic and (c) governance dimensions
               using five resilience domains: assets, flexibility, organization,
               learning and agency. We distil and define 38 attributes that
               confer climate resilience from a coupled literature- and
               expert-driven approach, describe how they apply to fisheries and
               provide illustrative examples of resilience attributes in action.
               Our synthesis highlights that the directionality and mechanism of
               these attributes depend on the specific context, capacities, and
               scale of the focal fishery system and associated stressors, and
               we find evidence of interdependencies among attributes. Overall,
               however, we find few studies that test resilience attributes in
               fisheries across all parts of the system, with most examples
               focussing on the ecological dimension. As such, meaningful
               quantification of the attributes? contributions to resilience

              scales. Such climate change impacts have the potential to lead to
              declines in marine fish production and compromise the livelihoods
              of fisheries dependent communities. Yet few studies have examined
              social vulnerability in the context of changes specific to coral
              reef ecosystems. In this paper, we examine three dimensions of
              vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of 29
              coastal communities across five western Indian Ocean countries to
              the impacts of coral bleaching on fishery returns. A key
              contribution is the development of a novel, network-based approach
              to examining sensitivity to changes in the fishery that
              incorporates linkages between fishery and non-fishery occupations.
              We find that key sources of vulnerability differ considerably

              results are specific to reef fisheries impacts from coral

               visited during a year (12 nautical miles from coast, beyond 12 nm

               other gears 24 m). The fleets were then characterised in terms of
               horse power, economic dependence on a list of nine dominant
               commercial species (sole, Nephrops, sea bass, hake, monkfish,
               anchovy, cuttlefish, sardine and squid) and their contribution to
               the landings of these species from the Bay of Biscay. Most fleets
               derived the majority of their income from one or two among the
               nine species. Species dependencies changed little during the
               study period, except for those vessels targeting anchovy before
               the fishery restrictions starting in 2005. Fish community impacts
               were compared based on fleet landings' profiles. Twelve landings

               Fleets using similar gears had the same landings' profiles and
               therefore exercised similar pressures on the ecosystem, though
               not always in the same areas. The depletion of anchovy and the
               closure of the fishery lead to a change in landings profile for
               offshore pelagic trawlers from anchovy dominance to one with a
               larger proportion of albacore and sea bass. During the study

              world, with a fishing fleet consisting of trawlers, purse-seiners
              and multi-gear vessels, which use a wide variety of fishing gears,
              such as gillnets, trammel nets, longlines or traps. Climate change
              affects ocean conditions, impacting marine organisms and
              ecosystems, with consequences for marine fisheries. The
              consequences of climate change on fishing communities will depend
              on their exposure to this factor, the sensitivity of target
              species and ecosystems to climate change and fishermen’s ability
              to adapt to climate change. The Portuguese coast is mainly
              north-south oriented and located in a biogeographic transition
              zone, between temperate and subtropical waters, where the northern
              or southern distribution limits of several species can be found.
              Also, the Portuguese coast is expected to suffer changes in
              temperature and precipitation more accelerated than the global
              mean alteration rate, which makes it particularly adequate for
              studies of the effect of climate change on coastal communities and
              fisheries. The present study analysed trends in landings of the
              most important fishing métiers in the Portuguese coast and the
              vulnerability and adaptation capacity of Portuguese fisheries to
              climate change. Official Portuguese landings (1992–2012) were
              analysed and a survey was conducted to assess fishermen’s
              perception of landings and their potential behaviour in response
              to the effects of climate change on fisheries. Eighteen new
              species were landed in Portuguese fisheries over the past 5 years,
              of which 12 were tropical or subtropical and 5 had their
              distribution limit along the Portuguese coast. A latitudinal
              pattern in the number of new species in landings was found,
              agreeing with a northward shift of subtropical species. The south
              coast has shown a higher vulnerability to climate change, in terms
              of both exposure and sensitivity of target species and ecosystems
              to its effects. Trawlermen may be more adaptable and less
              vulnerable to climate change, given the high mobility of their
              fleet. Multi-gear fisheries may be more flexible in changing
              target species or fishing gear, which makes them potentially less
              vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, the high
              sensitivity of sardine to the effects of climate change makes the
              purse-seine fisheries particularly vulnerable to climate change.",

              improve the status and management of fisheries. During its
              15years, the MSC, which has an annual budget of close to US\$20

              the MSC’s principles for sustainable fishing are too lenient and
              discretionary, and allow for overly generous interpretation by
              third-party certifiers and adjudicators, which means that the MSC

              between European and Northwest African waters populations, to
              propose stock units in the ICES region and to identify stock
              assessment approaches potentially applicable to those stocks
              taking into account the data available. The metadata on fisheries,
              surveys and biological information were compiled across the region
              from the Bay of Biscay to Senegal. Data from the northern part of
              the Bay of Biscay and from the Mediterranean Sea will be compiled
              in the future. The WK concluded that current information on chub
              mackerel population structure and dynamics is not sufficient to
              define stocks in the study area. Available data do not point to a
              continuous distribution from Europe to Northwest Africa (NWA)
              shelf waters. The species is fished across the area, with most
              landings by purse seiners from Biscay to central Morocco and by
              pelagic trawlersin southern Morocco. Landings increased in the
              last decade in all areas. In European waters, fisheries are
              unregulated apart from technical measures. A single stock is
              considered in NWA and is assessed yearly within a FAO-CECAF
              Working Group. If an assessment of chub mackerel is required in
              the ICES area, the WK considers that plausible stock scenarios
              are: (i) a single stock in the Bay of Biscay and Iberia Peninsula
              waters ecoregion or (ii) two stocks in the above ecoregion
              separated in the mid-Cantabrian Sea. The time-series of data
              currently available are sufficient to explore length-based or even
              age-based assessment models. A good approach would be to combine
              several methods of different complexity. The main limitations
              relate to stock identification, of age-determination criteria. The
              WK recommends a large-scale study of stock identity with a
              holistic approach, standardization of surveys and biological
              analyses both within and between European and NW African
              institutes. Finally, the WK highlights that the increase of
              landings and uncertainty about stock status, may require policy
              and management attention.",

              collected in acoustic surveys since the mid-1980s. Growth curves
              are fitted to annual or monthly length-at-age data using a robust
              Von Bertalanffy model; parameters for recent samples are compared
              with literature information using an auximetric plot while
              differences between areas within the Iberian-Biscay region are
              tested by log-likelihood ratio tests. Sardine growth performance
              is generally lower in the Mediterranean and declines across the
              northeastern Atlantic from the English Channel to north Morocco
              but increases sharply off Mauritania. Lower growth of
              Mediterranean sardines is possibly associated to the overall
              oligotrophy of this Sea while differentiation from the Atlantic is
              likely sustained by reproductive isolation between populations
              from the two areas. Within the northeastern Atlantic, size- and
              age related migrations may partly explain differences in maximum
              length/age and mean length-at-age between neighbouring areas but
              the broad-scale latitudinal decline in growth is consistent with
              adaptation to the north–south decline in seasonal temperature
              gradients and to the annual cycles of plankton production. Within
              the Atlantic Iberian waters, sardine grows and improves in
              condition during spring and summer when the allocation of
              energetic resources for gonad development cease, temperature is
              close to the annual maxima and plankton production is high.
              Variation in sardine length-at-age and growth within the
              Atlanto-Iberian stock area has implications for stock structure
              and needs to be taken into account in the calculation of weight
              and maturity-at-age for assessment purposes. No evidence of broad
              temporal changes in sardine growth within the Iberian-Biscay

              landings. At present, these fleets mainly target sardine (Sardina
              pilchardus) and chub mackerel (Scomber colias). This work aimed to
              study the Portuguese purse seine fleet activity (vessel
              length>16m) and catch composition using onboard observations from
              2009 to 2013. Data were collected during 179 trips and 229 fishing
              sets. Short trips (mean 9.38 h) with one to two sets (duration
              time 1.39 h/set) were observed, where most of the trip was
              dedicated to searching (43.7\% of total trip duration) and fishing
              (23.5\%). Fishing time depended of the number of sets and search
              time, which increased due to the growing scarcity of fish and
              distance to and from fishing grounds to the homeport. S. colias
              was the main species captured followed by S. pilchardus, although
              there were an inverse trend in the two species landings. Other
              pelagic species such as horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus),
              Atlantic mackerel (S. scombrus), blue jack mackerel (T.
              picturatus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were also caught
              but represented small volumes of the catch. The average capture
              and landings observed were 4.47 (±S.D. 7.64) and 3.19 (±S.D. 4.46)
              tons per set. Capture and landings were both higher in the North,
              intermediate in the South and lower in the Centre. Differences
              between fish captured and fish landed are due to slipping.
              Slipping was more frequent in the North, mainly because of the
              implementation of daily limit quotas. In the South, usually was
              the result of the mixture of S. pilchardus with non-commercial
              species that would decrease its landing price. Throughout the
              study period, S. pilchardus landings peaked of 64 000 ton in 2008,
              decreased 20\% until 2011 and dropped sharply after 2012. Landing
              patterns of S. colias, the second most important species, have
              been inverse, increasing continuously since 2009. On the overall,
              the decline of S. pilchardus landings has been compensated by
              increasing capture and landings of S. colias along the country.",

               in many fisheries worldwide. Unlike the pelagic purse-seine, the
               demersal purse seine usually targets high commercial value
               demersal species such as sea breams (e.g., Diplodus spp.,
               Pagellus spp., Sparus aurata) and the European sea bass
               (Dicentrarchus labrax), while discards consist mainly of pelagic
               species and juveniles of the above mentioned species. In order to
               evaluate the efficiency of a selectivity device in reducing
               bycatch and consequently of discards in a demersal purse seine
               fishery, experimental deployments were carried out. The bycatch
               reducing device (BRD) consisted in the use of a panel of
               diamond-shaped mesh netting of 70 mm stretched mesh in the
               posterior part of the purse seine. Data from 61 experimental
               fishing trials allowed the evaluation of discards, with Scomber
               japonicus, Boops boops, Sardina pilchardus, Diplodus bellottii
               and Belone belone being the main discarded species. The mean
               discard ratio per set was 0.49 (± 0.30 standard deviation). The
               causes for discarding were also identified, with low commercial
               value being the most important reason. The results of the trials
               with BRD, were promising, with an average of 49\% (± 24\%) of the
               fish escaping per set, especially from those species that are
               most discarded. Overall, the use of this method for reducing
               discards can be considered positive for the following reasons:
               there is no need for structural modification of the fishing gear,
               the BRD is easy to deploy, and it is efficient in terms of
               species, sizes and quantities of fish that manage to escape. It
               therefore has significant benefits for the demersal purse seine
               fishery and possibly for other “métiers” as well.",

              catch regime ended up with a fishery crash and closure (2005–2009)
              after a series of recruitment failures. Precautionary advices had
              been disregarded due to their inability to predict the size of the
              population during the first half of the year when the major
              fishery takes place. The crash triggered the EU to develop a
              long-term management plan in 2008. In the absence of a recruitment
              indicator, biological risk was minimized through a close coupling
              between assessment, advice and management, changing the management
              year to start just after the spring surveys on adults. A major
              improvement arrived in 2014 by the incorporation of an early
              recruitment indicator from an autumn acoustic survey on juveniles.
              This allowed additional exploitation of the resource at similar
              risk levels. Accordingly, TACs are nowadays set after the recruit
              survey on a management calendar basis. The interactive
              collaboration between fishers, scientists, and managers allowed
              inclusion of the stakeholders’ preferences for a biomass-based
              catch bounded harvest strategy suitable for these valuable
              fisheries. This strategy allows catches between a minimum and
              maximum TAC level, to account for an economically viable minimum
              activity when approaching a minimum biomass threshold level, and
              for the limited market absorption capacity when exceeding an upper
              biomass threshold level, respectively. Such strategy was adopted
              by consensus and supposed a successful participatory process in
              fishery management.",

               succession of low recruitments, resulting in the collapse of the
               stock in 2005; this has led to successive closures of the
               fishery. This study investigates the possible impact of different
               controlling factors [North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East
               Atlantic (EA) pattern, turbulence, upwelling, and river flow]

               of the recruitment variability of this fishery can be explained
               by upwelling over the spawning area; this is related, in turn, to
               the EA pattern. The conceptual understanding of the system
               proposed for the Bay of Biscay anchovy suggests that negative EA
               periods are associated with northeasterly wind circulation, which
               produces weak upwelling over the continental shelf. This pattern
               results in hydrodynamic stability over the area, leading,
               probably, to adequate food availability. A positive EA (which
               extends onwards, from 1998) is associated with southwesterly
               winds and downwelling over the continental shelf; this leads,
               probably, to the dispersion of anchovy food and larvae, together

               The control function (CF) method can be used to address this
               model flaw in discrete-choice models in which the problem occurs
               at the level of each alternative. However, the CF requires
               instrumental variables, which are difficult to obtain in various
               practical cases. In comparison, the multiple indicator solution
               (MIS) method does not require instruments, but indicators, which
               may be easier to gather in various circumstances. The MIS method
               has only been described so far for linear models. In this
               article, we show that MIS can be extended to discrete-choice
               modelling under mild assumptions. We also discuss the conditions

               the MIS method to an SP experiment of dwelling choice, showing

              this article is to contribute in closing that gap by assessing
              five methods to address endogeneity in this context: the use of
              Proxys (PR); the two steps Control-Function (CF) method; the
              simultaneous estimation of the CF method via Maximum-Likelihood
              (ML); the Multiple Indicator Solution (MIS); and the integration
              of Latent-Variables (LV). The assessment is first made
              qualitatively, in terms of the formulation, normalization and data
              needs of each method. Then, the evaluation is made quantitatively,
              by means of a Monte Carlo experiment to study the finite sample
              properties under a unified data generation process, and to analyze
              the impact of common flaws. The methods studied differ notably in
              the range of problems that they can address; their underlying
              assumptions; the difficulty of gathering proper auxiliary
              variables needed to apply them; and their practicality, both in
              terms of the need for coding and their computational burden. The
              analysis developed in this article shows that PR is formally
              inappropriate for many cases, but it is easy to apply, and often
              corrects in the right direction. CF is also easy to apply with
              canned software, but requires instrumental variables which may be
              hard to collect in various contexts. Since CF is estimated in two
              stages, it may also compromise efficiency and difficult the
              estimation of standard errors. ML guarantees efficiency and direct
              estimation of the standard errors, but at the cost of larger
              computational burden required for the estimation of a multifold
              integral, with potential difficulties in identification, and
              retaining the difficulty of gathering proper instrumental
              variables. The MIS method appears relatively easy to apply and
              requiring indicators that may be easier to obtain in various
              cases. Finally, the LV approach appears as the more versatile
              method, but at a high cost in computational burden, problems of
              identification and limitations in the capability of writing proper
              structural equations for the latent variable.",

              westward by 1650 km and northward by 400 km. Distribution range
              peaked in 2014 and was positively correlated to SSB. Mackerel was
              present in temperatures ranging from 5 °C to 15 °C, but preferred
              areas with temperatures between 9 °C and 13 °C according to
              univariate quotient analysis. Generalized additive models showed
              that both mackerel occurrence and density were positively related
              to location, ambient temperature, mesozooplankton density and SSB,
              explaining 47\% and 32\% of deviance, respectively. Mackerel
              relative mean weight-at-length was positively related to location,
              day-of-year, temperature and SSB, but not with mesozooplankton
              density, explaining 40\% of the deviance. We conclude that
              geographical expansion of mackerel during the summer feeding
              season in Nordic Seas was driven by increasing mackerel stock size
              and constrained by availability of preferred temperature and
              abundance of mesozooplankton. Marine climate with multidecadal
              variability probably impacted the observed distributional changes
              but were not evaluated. Our results were limited to the direct
              effects of temperature, mesozooplankton abundance, and SSB on
              distribution range during the last two decades and should be
              viewed as such.",

              anchovy Engraulis capensisand round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi.
              Two separate TACs (Total Allowable Catch) for sardine are
              calculated in the management procedures considered. The first is a
              directed TAC linked to sardine abundance, and the second is a
              bycatch TAC with an “anchovy” component coupled to the anchovy
              population dynamics as a proportion of the anchovy TAC, plus a
              “round herring” component reflecting a fixed tonnage independent
              of round herring abundance. Requirements from the pelagic
              industry, such as a minimum economically viable annual directed
              catch and a maximum percentage decrease in the directed TAC that
              could be tolerated from year to year are also incorporated. The
              selection of a single management procedure for implementation is
              based on the comparison of performance statistics such as risk of
              severe depletion and average annual catch, which incorporate the
              consequences of random error in survey estimates of abundance and
              random fluctuations in recruitment from year to year. Sensitivity
              tests are carried out to ensure robustness over a range of
              alternative assumptions concerning resource dynamics. A
              description is given of the development of the management
              procedure for sardine thatwas implemented in 1994, and the
              rationale for its selection. A wide range of variants to this
              procedure, including those that consider alternative approaches
              for handling bycatch, are investigated. Performance of the
              management procedures considered demonstrates extreme sensitivity
              to the choice of the proportion of the anchovy TAC used in the
              sardine bycatch TAC calculation. A lack of robustness of the
              selected management procedure to possible bias in estimates of
              spawner biomass from hydroacoustic surveys, and poor precision of
              recruit survey estimatesare argued as justification for adopting a

               largest in terms of annual catch (ca 380 000 tonnes on average)
               and the second most valuable. Sardine (Sardinops sagax) and
               anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) combined make up an average of
               80 percent of annual catches by this fishery, with West Coast
               round herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) of lesser importance. The
               sardines are canned or frozen, while anchovy and round herring
               are reduced to fish meal and oil. This fishery has been
               identified as one of South Africa’s most vulnerable to climate
               change impacts, primarily because of the economic value of the
               catch and the large number of people involved in catching and
               processing. Some changes in the oceanography, and in distribution
               patterns and abundance trends of these three small pelagic fishes
               have been observed, and may be attributable to climate change.
               Both anchovy and sardine have shown shifts in their relative
               distributions (from the West to the South Coast) that are
               significantly correlated with cross-shelf sea surface temperature
               gradients off the South Coast: this has had negative impacts on
               the sardine but not the anchovy fishery. Since 2000 the
               population sizes of anchovy and round herring have been higher
               than before, possibly due to increased upwelling – anchovy
               recruitment strength has been shown to be significantly
               correlated with cumulative summer upwelling. In contrast, the
               sardine population size has been low since the mid-2000s and is
               presently very low, possibly as a result of deleterious impacts
               on sardine (but not on anchovy or round herring) of recent
               harmful algal blooms off the South Coast: these may be driven by
               climate change. The decline in the sardine population and its
               present depleted status has had substantial impacts on the small
               pelagic fishery, and is a critical and immediate concern. The
               fishery must adapt to this change and prepare for further change
               in future by better utilization of current and new resources, at
               least in the short term. Adaptation measures that have been
               implemented include importing frozen sardines to keep factories
               operational and meet local demand, and the development of an
               experimental fishery for the mesopelagic lanternfish
               (Lampanyctodes hectoris). Other potential adaptation measures
               include rebuilding the sardine population; developing anchovy
               products (fillets, dried, etc.) for human consumption, including
               developing markets; investigating the use of larger vessels with
               different fishing gear (i.e. pelagic and midwater trawls instead
               of purse-seiners) to harvest anchovy and round herring; fishing
               off the South Coast for anchovy and developing processing
               infrastructure there; increasing present low exploitation levels
               on round herring and developing canned products for human
               consumption; and developing an integrated research response to
               improve forecasting of likely climate change impacts on these
               species and the fisheries they support.",

              It has been suggested that this represents the spawning migration
              of a distinct subtropical stock. Using genomic and transcriptomic
              data from sardines collected around the South African coast, we

              sardines participating in the sardine run are primarily of
              Atlantic origin and thus prefer colder water. These sardines
              separate from the warm-temperate stock and move into temporarily
              favorable Indian Ocean habitat during brief cold-water upwelling

              putative stock (sardine caught off the west coast were assumed to
              be from the putative “western” stock whereas those caught off the
              south coast were assumed to be from the putative “southern”
              stock), season, year, fish size and all possible two-way

              prevalence and a negative binomial distribution assumed for
              infection intensity and parasite abundance. The most parsimonious
              model for each index was selected based on Akaike's Information
              Criterion, and significant GLMs were derived for all three

              explaining deviance seen in infection intensity and parasite
              abundance, and was the second most important contributor to
              explaining deviance seen in infection prevalence, with fish from
              the putative western stock having significantly (p<0.001) higher
              parasite loads compared to those from the putative southern stock.
              Temporal variability was also observed, with season and year also
              contributing significantly to all three models. Despite this
              temporal variability, the marked spatial difference in the

              the hypothesis of western and southern stocks of sardine off the

               are among the most varied and productive in the world. They also
               offer a laboratory example of the mismanagement and waste that
               have attended the settlement and development of the North
               American continent. The Fisherman's Problem is a study of the
               interaction among resource ecology, economic enterprise, and law
               in the history of the California fishing industry. It analyzes
               the ways in which the natural environment not only provided the
               raw material for economic development but played an active role
               in it as well. As this book shows, the natural environment has a
               history both independent of, and yet influenced by, classic
               example of 'common property' re-environmental conservation
               generally, as well as in the management of the fisheries of the
               world's rivers and oceans. Professor McEvoy discusses the
               different ways in which human communities have harvested and
               managed the region's fisheries, from those of the American
               Indians and immigrants from Europe and Asia to those of modern,
               industrial-bureaucratic society. By reconstructing the ecological
               history of the fisheries during the nineteenth and twentieth
               centuries, this study develops a new perspective on environmental
               problems as contemporary observers understood them and on the
               results of their efforts to deal with those problems. The book
               concludes with an analysis of significant changes taking place in
               the 1970s and 1980s in the politics and theory of resource
               management. By combining a synthesis of recent scholarship in
               such disciplines as law, economics, marine biology, and
               anthropology with original research into the fishing industry's
               history, the book represents a significant new departure in the

               organisms. Direct effects include changes in growth and
               mortality; indirect effects include changes in distribution,
               movement, and interactions with other species. For mobile
               species, such as the pelagic filter-feeding Gulf Menhaden
               Brevoortia patronus, indirect effects are more prevalent than
               direct effects. The northern Gulf of Mexico experiences one of
               the largest areas of seasonal hypoxia in the world; this area
               overlaps spatially and temporally with the Gulf Menhaden
               commercial purse-seine fishery, which is among the largest
               fisheries by weight in the United States. Harvest records from
               the Gulf Menhaden fishery in 2006?2009 and fine-scale spatial and
               temporal predictions from a physical?biogeochemical model were

               fishing, total Gulf Menhaden catch, total fishery effort, and
               CPUE. We found nearshore shifts in the probability of fishing as
               DO concentration declined, and we detected a general westward
               shift in all response variables. We also found increases in CPUE
               as DO concentration declined in the Louisiana Bight, an area that

               to be moderate. Nevertheless, movement of either Gulf Menhaden or
               the purse-seine fishery in response to environmental conditions
               could potentially affect the susceptibility of Gulf Menhaden to
               harvest and could therefore influence assessment of the stock and

              worldwide that threatens marine ecosystem services, but little is
              known about economic effects on fisheries. Here, we provide
              evidence that hypoxia causes economic impacts on a major fishery.
              Ecological studies of hypoxia and marine fauna suggest multiple
              mechanisms through which hypoxia can skew a population's size
              distribution toward smaller individuals. These mechanisms produce
              sharp predictions about changes in seafood markets. Hypoxia is
              hypothesized to decrease the quantity of large shrimp relative to
              small shrimp and increase the price of large shrimp relative to
              small shrimp. We test these hypotheses using time series of
              size-based prices. Naive quantity-based models using
              treatment/control comparisons in hypoxic and nonhypoxic areas
              produce null results, but we find strong evidence of the
              hypothesized effects in the relative prices: Hypoxia increases the
              relative price of large shrimp compared with small shrimp. The
              effects of fuel prices provide supporting evidence. Empirical
              models of fishing effort and bioeconomic simulations explain why
              quantifying effects of hypoxia on fisheries using quantity data
              has been inconclusive. Specifically, spatial-dynamic feedbacks
              across the natural system (the fish stock) and human system (the
              mobile fishing fleet) confound ``treated'' and ``control'' areas.
              Consequently, analyses of price data, which rely on a market
              counterfactual, are able to reveal effects of the ecological
              disturbance that are obscured in quantity data. Our results are an
              important step toward quantifying the economic value of reduced

               fisheries bycatch, but their effectiveness and economic impact
               can be influenced by the changes in species distributions. For
               fisheries targeting highly mobile species, the economic impact of
               a closure may by highly dynamic, depending on the current
               suitability of the closed area for the target species. We present
               an analysis to quantify the fine-scale economic impact of
               time-area closures: the ?lost economic opportunity?, which is the
               percentage of total potential profit for an entire fishing season
               that occurs within and during a time-area closure. Our analysis
               integrates a spatially explicit and environment-informed catch
               model with a utility model that quantifies fishing revenues and
               costs, and thus incorporates a dynamic target species
               distribution in the estimated economic impact of a closure. We
               demonstrate this approach by evaluating the economic impact of
               the Loggerhead Conservation Area (LCA) on California's drift
               gillnet swordfish Xiphias gladius fishery. The lost economic
               opportunity due to the LCA time-area closure ranged from 0\% to
               6\% per season, with variation due to port location and trip
               duration, as well as inter-annual changes in swordfish
               distribution. This increased by 40\%?90\% when a seasonally
               varying swordfish price was considered. There was a clear signal
               in economic impact associated with a shift from warm to cool
               conditions in the California Current following the 1998 El Niño,

               was due to higher swordfish catch inside the LCA during the cool
               phase, associated with increased water column mixing, and due to
               higher catches outside the LCA in the warmer phase, associated
               with increased sea-surface temperature. Synthesis and

               closure, but with meaningful inter-annual variation due to
               environmental change and the dynamic distribution of a target
               species. Our approach could be used to help determine the timing
               of closures, simulate impacts of proposed closures and, more
               generally, assess some economic consequences of climate-induced
               shifts in species? ranges.",

              of principle that such coupled models can be developed and
              implemented. The end-to-end model is 3-dimensional, time-varying,
              and multispecies, and consists of four coupled submodels:
              hydrodynamics, Eulerian nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton (NPZ),
              an individual-based full life cycle anchovy and sardine submodel,
              and an agent-based fishing fleet submodel. A predator roughly
              mimicking albacore was included as individuals that consumed
              anchovy and sardine. All submodels were coded within the ROMS
              open-source community model, and used the same resolution spatial
              grid and were all solved simultaneously to allow for possible
              feedbacks among the submodels. We used a super-individual approach
              and solved the coupled models on a distributed memory parallel
              computer, both of which created challenging but resolvable
              bookkeeping challenges. The anchovy and sardine growth, mortality,
              reproduction, and movement, and the fishing fleet submodel, were
              each calibrated using simplified grids before being inserted into
              the full end-to-end model. An historical simulation of 1959–2008
              was performed, and the latter 45years analyzed. Sea surface height
              (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) for the historical
              simulation showed strong horizontal gradients and multi-year scale
              temporal oscillations related to various climate indices (PDO,
              NPGO), and both showed responses to ENSO variability. Simulated
              total phytoplankton was lower during strong El Nino events and
              higher for the strong 1999 La Nina event. The three zooplankton
              groups generally corresponded to the spatial and temporal
              variation in simulated total phytoplankton. Simulated biomasses of
              anchovy and sardine were within the historical range of observed
              biomasses but predicted biomasses showed much less inter-annual
              variation. Anomalies of annual biomasses of anchovy and sardine
              showed a switch in the mid-1990s from anchovy to sardine
              dominance. Simulated averaged weights- and lengths-at-age did not
              vary much across decades, and movement patterns showed anchovy
              located close to the coast while sardine were more dispersed and
              farther offshore. Albacore predation on anchovy and sardine was
              concentrated near the coast in two pockets near the Monterey Bay
              area and equatorward of Cape Mendocino. Predation mortality from
              fishing boats was concentrated where sardine age-1 and older
              individuals were located close to one of the five ports. We
              demonstrated that it is feasible to perform multi-decadal
              simulations of a fully-coupled end-to-end model, and that this can
              be done for a model that follows individual fish and boats on the
              same 3-dimensional grid as the hydrodynamics. Our focus here was
              on proof of principle and our results showed that we solved the
              major technical, bookkeeping, and computational issues. We discuss
              the next steps to increase computational speed and to include
              important biological differences between anchovy and sardine. In a
              companion paper (Fiechter et al., 2015), we further analyze the
              historical simulation in the context of the various hypotheses
              that have been proposed to explain the sardine and anchovy cycles.",

               catches have important efficiency and distributional implications

               locations choices have received little attention. We develop a
               model of fishers? landing sites in northern Norway. While fishers
               are highly responsive to travel distance, we find that expected
               revenues are a lesser driver of landing location choices. Rather,
               choices are dominated by strong state dependence, and most
               vessels always land at the same port. These results suggest that
               economic policies designed to redistribute landings in order to
               aid certain communities would not necessarily draw fishers away
               from their preferred landing sites. On the other hand, the
               responsiveness of some fishers to intraseasonal stock movements
               offers a glimpse of how climate change could reshape the spatial

              the species that ecologically most contribute to the vulnerability
              of the landings are key steps to evaluate the risk posed by
              climate change. We analyse the temporal variability in intrinsic
              sensitivity and the ecological vulnerability of the Portuguese
              fisheries landings, considering the species proportions derived
              both from the weights and revenues. To account for the

              dependence of the fishery in combination with the vulnerability of
              them. The analyses were carried out separately for three fleet
              typologies and three regions. Opposite to what has been observed
              at a global scale, the ecological sensitivity of the fisheries
              landings between 1989 and 2015 did not display a decline across
              areas or fishing fleets. Considering each fleet independently, for
              trawling, where average vulnerability was lower than in the other
              fleets, the sensitivity of the landings increased since the 2000s.
              On the other hand, the high vulnerability found in multi-gear
              fleets was compensated by diversification of the species caught,
              while purse-seine fleets targeted low vulnerability species but
              presented a high fishery dependence on few species. The results

              trawl sampling in the 3–5 months preceding the onset of the

               aquaculture, can result in reliance on a few economically
               valuable species. This lack of diversity may increase risks of
               ecological and economic disruptions. Centuries of intense fishing
               have extirpated most apex predators in the Gulf of Maine (United
               States and Canada), effectively creating an American lobster
               (Homarus americanus) monoculture. Over the past 20 years, the
               economic diversity of marine resources harvested in Maine has
               declined by almost 70\%. Today, over 80\% of the value of Maine's
               fish and seafood landings is from highly abundant lobsters.
               Inflation-corrected income from lobsters in Maine has steadily
               increased by nearly 400\% since 1985. Fisheries managers, policy
               makers, and fishers view this as a success. However, such
               lucrative monocultures increase the social and ecological
               consequences of future declines in lobsters. In southern New
               England, disease and stresses related to increases in ocean
               temperature resulted in more than a 70\% decline in lobster
               abundance, prompting managers to propose closing that fishery. A
               similar collapse in Maine could fundamentally disrupt the social
               and economic foundation of its coast. We suggest the current
               success of Maine's lobster fishery is a gilded trap. Gilded traps
               are a type of social trap in which collective actions resulting
               from economically attractive opportunities outweigh concerns over
               associated social and ecological risks or consequences. Large
               financial gain creates a strong reinforcing feedback that deepens
               the trap. Avoiding or escaping gilded traps requires managing for
               increased biological and economic diversity. This is difficult to
               do prior to a crisis while financial incentives for maintaining
               the status quo are large. The long-term challenge is to shift
               fisheries management away from single species toward integrated
               social-ecological approaches that diversify local ecosystems,
               societies, and economies.",

              to managing these industries is identifying how regulatory actions
              and individual behavior affect income variability, financial risk,
              and, by extension, the economic stability and the sustainable use
              of natural resources. In commercial fisheries, communities and
              vessels fishing a greater diversity of species have less revenue
              variability than those fishing fewer species. However, it is
              unclear whether these benefits extend to the actions of individual
              fishers and how year-to-year changes in diversification affect
              revenue and revenue variability. Here, we evaluate two axes by
              which fishers in Alaska can diversify fishing activities. We show
              that, despite increasing specialization over the last 30 years,
              fishing a set of permits with higher species diversity reduces
              individual revenue variability, and fishing an additional permit
              is associated with higher revenue and lower variability. However,
              increasing species diversity within the constraints of existing
              permits has a fishery-dependent effect on revenue and is usually
              (87\% probability) associated with increased revenue uncertainty
              the following year. Our results demonstrate that the most
              effective option for individuals to decrease revenue variability
              is to participate in additional or more diverse fisheries.
              However, this option is expensive, often limited by regulations
              such as catch share programs, and consequently unavailable to many
              individuals. With increasing climatic variability, it will be
              particularly important that individuals relying on natural

              variability, leading to variability in the income derived by
              fishery participants. The economic risk posed by this may be
              mitigated in some cases if individuals participate in several
              different fisheries, particularly if revenues from those fisheries
              are uncorrelated or vary asynchronously. We construct indices of
              gross income diversification from fisheries at the level of
              individual vessels and find that the income of the current fleet
              of vessels on the US West Coast and in Alaska is less diverse than
              at any point in the past 30 y. We also find a dome-shaped
              relationship between the variability of individuals' income and
              income diversification, which implies that a small amount of
              diversification does not reduce income risk but that higher levels
              of diversification can substantially reduce the variability of
              income from fishing. Moving from a single fishery strategy to a
              50-25-25 split in revenues reduces the expected coefficient of
              variation of gross revenues between 24\% and 65\% for the vessels
              included in this study. The increasing access restrictions in many
              marine fisheries through license reductions and moratoriums have
              the potential to limit fishermen's ability to diversify their
              income risk across multiple fisheries. Catch share programs often
              result in consolidation initially and may reduce diversification.
              However, catch share programs also make it feasible for fishermen
              to build a portfolio of harvest privileges and potentially reduce
              their income risk. Therefore, catch share programs create both

              this article, economic risk – as measured by community-level
              fishing gross revenues variability – is characterized across
              Alaskan fishing communities over the past two decades, and
              exploratory analyses are conducted to identify associations
              between community attributes and revenues variability. Results
              show that communities’ fishing portfolio size and diversification
              are strongly related to fishing revenues variability. Communities
              with larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios experience
              lower fishing revenues variability. Portfolio size and
              diversification appear to be related to the number of local

              higher fishing revenues variability for communities in north and

              thereby limiting the policy options available to promote economic
              stability through larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios.
              For such communities, diversifying income across non-fishing

              communities, which were severely affected through closures of the
              Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified
              flows of users between fishery resources during the closures.
              These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of
              resource use and were associated with three strategies used by
              fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures:
              temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the

              large-scale drivers on shifts in effort and outcomes among three
              closely linked fisheries in Monterey Bay since the
              Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of
              1976. In this region, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), northern
              anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and market squid (Loligo opalescens)
              fisheries comprise a tightly linked system where shifting focus
              among fisheries is a key element to adaptive capacity and reduced
              social and ecological vulnerability. Using a cluster analysis of
              landings, we identify four modes from 1974 to 2012 that are
              dominated (i.e., a given species accounting for the plurality of
              landings) by squid, sardine, anchovy, or lack any dominance, and
              seven points of transition among these periods. This approach

              drivers are predominantly attributed to dominance transitions.
              Model selection of external drivers indicates that governance
              phases, reflected as perceived abundance, dictate long-term
              outcomes. Our findings suggest that globally, small-scale fishery

               fishery systems worldwide, the ability of harvesters to maintain
               a diverse portfolio of fishing strategies is important for
               building adaptive capacity. We used a case-study approach to
               examine the complexity of factors that inhibit or promote
               diversification in fisheries of Alaska, one of the major fishing
               regions of the world. Through a combination of harvest records
               and literature review, we explored shifts in participation and
               portfolio diversity in Alaskan fisheries over three decades. The
               four case-studies examined the responses of fishers, fleets and
               communities to multiple, intersecting pressures, including
               biological declines, market and price dynamics, fishery
               privatization and the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These cases
               illustrate how stressors acting at multiple scales can encourage
               or constrain opportunities for diversification, and that these
               opportunities may be spread inequitably across participants.
               Overall, we found evidence for reduced participation and
               increasing specialization in Alaskan commercial fisheries. While
               numerous factors explain these trends, policies like individual
               quota systems and the increasing cost of entry into fisheries are
               forcing consolidation at local to regional scales. A portfolio
               approach to managing fisheries that reduces barriers to
               diversification and includes broad representation of resource

               modern fisheries management treats fishermen as specialists using

               fishermen over 35+ years with explicit attention to changes in
               the structure and function of the albacore (Thunnus alalunga,

               heterogenous impacts upon the livelihood strategies favoured by
               different segments of regional fishing fleets. As ecological

              able to adapt to dramatic shifts in the geographic range of the
              fishery given their high mobility, with fishermen with larger
              vessels expressing a willingness to travel greater distances than
              those with smaller vessels. Nearly half of fishermen stated that

              in abundance, although fishermen who were older, had been in the

              locations is a key mechanism to adapt to such changes and maintain
              fisheries livelihoods. Here we explore environmental and
              institutional factors mediating how patterns of spatial
              diversification (i.e., utilization of alternative fishing grounds)
              and target species diversification change over time. Using
              small-scale fisheries in Baja California Sur (Mexico) as a case
              study, we adopt a social-ecological network approach to conduct a
              spatially explicit analysis of fisheries landings data
              (2008–2016). This approach quantifies relative patterns of
              diversification, and when combined with a qualitative analysis of
              existing literature, enables us to illuminate institutional and
              environmental factors that may influence diversification

              that small-scale fisheries policies need to better account such

              models assume single-species fisheries with perfectly elastic
              demand and focus on inter-seasonal dynamics. In real-world
              fisheries, vessels hold quotas for multiple species with
              heterogeneous biological and/or market conditions that vary
              intra-seasonally. We analyze within-season behavior in
              multispecies fisheries with individual fishing quotas, accounting
              for stock aggregations, capacity constraints, and downward-sloping
              demand. Numerical results demonstrate variation in harvest
              patterns. We specifically find: (1) harvests for species with

              of a high-value species can cause lower-value species to be

              of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal
              shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout
              the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of
              phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the
              variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar
              adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous
              responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage
              assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large
              oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Niño to
              La Niña conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the
              onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013–2014. Changes
              in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in
              the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the
              Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop
              can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community
              composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context

               show interannual and multiyear shifts in species dominance that
               are tracked by survival of salmon populations. These zooplankton
               community changes correlate with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
               (PDO) index: a ‘warm-water’ copepod species group is more
               abundant during warm (positive) phases of the PDO and less
               abundant during cold (negative) phases; the reverse occurs for a
               ‘cold-water’ species group. The observed relationship led to the
               hypothesis that the relative dominance of warm/cold-water
               copepods in the NCC is driven by changes in the horizontal
               advection of surface water over different phases of the PDO. To
               test this hypothesis, variation in surface water advection to
               coastal regions of the NCC over the period of 1950–2008 was
               investigated using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and
               passive tracer experiments, then was compared with zooplankton
               collected off Oregon since 1996. Results showed that surface
               water advection varied with the phase of the PDO; the
               low-frequency component of advection anomalies strongly
               correlated with copepod species composition (R40.9). During
               positive phases of the PDO, current anomalies were northward and
               onshore, resulting in transport of warmer waters and the
               associated copepods into the region. During negatives phases,
               increased equatorward current anomalies led to a copepod
               community that was dominated by cold-water taxa. Our results
               support the hypothesis that climate-driven changes in basin-scale
               circulation controls copepod community composition in the NCC,
               and demonstrate that large-scale climate forcings downscale to
               influence local and regional ecosystem structure.",

              index of large-scale climate variability in the region - the

              Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale

               Half Moon Bay, California, from 2011 to 2016. Warming local ocean
               conditions and a strong El Nino event drove a dramatic decline in

               locations as well as marginal habitats in northern areas. To
               examine this potential phenomenon, we used fisheries-independent
               survey data collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service
               between 1998 and 2019 to develop a spatiotemporal model that

              and the catch location of commercial fishing trips landing summer
              flounder. This is followed by a description of the institutional
              context of summer flounder fishery management and a narrative
              policy analysis of the ongoing regulatory process. Results
              indicate significant northward movement of both resource and
              resource users. Fisheries movement patterns are a result of both

               species caught. A majority of fishing communities were projected
               to face declining future fishing opportunities unless they adapt,
               either through catching new species or fishing in new locations.
               By integrating climatic, ecological and socio-economic data at a
               scale relevant to fishing communities, this analysis identifies
               where strategies for adapting to the ecological impacts of
               climate change will be most needed. Climate change is projected
               to directly impact fishing communities through changes to habitat
               for marine species. A socio-ecological approach is developed to
               assess fishing community exposure to climate change risk and
               applied to New England and Mid-Atlantic (USA) fishing
               communities.",

               choices of this fleet were identified using multivariate
               statistical methods based on species landings weighted by value
               and defined as distinct fishing activity or fisheries (termed
               métiers). A RUM was specified, which included trip components as
               attributes during the period 2001–2004 (a lagged percentage of
               the value per unit of effort of the main species caught, total
               value per unit of effort, and inertia in terms of changes from
               one métier to another). For the main métiers, the proportion of
               correct effort allocation is 90\% during the calibration period
               of 2001–2004. The results from the RUM are used to parameterize a
               simulation model of trip choice. The model is used to predict

              addresses these two problems simultaneously by using an unusual

              unobservable abundance information is captured by location- and

               production and adaptive response within a small-scale fishery in
               the central Gulf of California following system perturbation.
               Using mixed methods from the natural and social sciences, we (1)
               identify local drivers of social-ecological change, (2) document

               behaviors. As climate change leads to warmer, more acidic, and
               less oxygenated oceans, species are shifting away from their
               historical distribution ranges, and these trends are expected to
               continue into the future. Correlative Species Distribution Models
               (SDMs) can be used to project future habitat extent for marine
               species, with many different statistical methods available.
               However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods
               behave under novel environmental conditions before using these
               models for management advice, and to consider whether future
               projections based on these techniques are biologically
               reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of
               two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California
               Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and
               northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM
               methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to
               complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some
               SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost
               substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from
               more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a
               marine heatwave were outside the range of historical
               measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent
               for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships
               between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through
               time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions
               markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained
               their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results
               suggest that correlative relationships between species and their
               environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions.
               Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is
               therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust
               to rapidly changing environments. Developing distribution models
               that offer skillful predictions into the future for species such
               as sardine and anchovy, which are migratory and include separate
               sub-stocks, may be particularly challenging.",

              describe the movements and activities of industrial fishing
              fleets, their use has been limited within the small-scale
              fisheries employing the vast majority of the world’s capture
              fishers. Here we combine novel vessel tracking technology with
              logbook data to conduct a high-resolution analysis of behavior and
              decision-making within a small-scale fishery. Our results indicate
              significant heterogeneity in fisher behavior, catch composition,
              and profits within a small-scale fleet operating in the central
              Gulf of California, even amongst fishing vessels using similar
              gear types. The weekly home ranges (75 \% Kernel Utilization
              Distribution) occupied by fishers spanned 1.5–1121.8 km2 across 13
              vessels, while weekly profits ranged from -1810 to 26,160 pesos.
              Differences in the spatial interactions and catch profiles of
              observed vessels revealed the existence of behavioral associations
              linked with distinct fishing strategies. After identifying and
              describing the contextual factors driving such heterogeneity among
              vessels using hook and line fishing gear, we interpret emergent
              patterns and processes using insights from foraging theory and
              marine social science. In illustrating the applications and
              opportunities presented by recent advances in vessel tracking
              technology, we argue for the use of spatially explicit analytical
              approaches in assessing behavioral diversity within small-scale
              fisheries and in designing robust and equitable management
              strategies.",

               been widely used in several applications, notably in papers on
               tests of the purchasing power parity hypothesis. This test is
               based on a very restrictive hypothesis which is rarely ever of
               interest in practice. The Im?Pesaran?Shin (IPS) test relaxes the
               restrictive assumption of the LL test. This paper argues that
               although the IPS test has been offered as a generalization of the
               LL test, it is best viewed as a test for summarizing the evidence
               from a number of independent tests of the sample hypothesis. This
               problem has a long statistical history going back to R. A.
               Fisher. This paper suggests the Fisher test as a panel data unit
               root test, compares it with the LL and IPS tests, and the
               Bonferroni bounds test which is valid for correlated tests.
               Overall, the evidence points to the Fisher test with
               bootstrap-based critical values as the preferred choice. We also
               suggest the use of the Fisher test for testing stationarity as

              are devised under more general assumptions than the tests
              previously proposed. First, the number of groups in the panel data
              is assumed to be either finite or infinite. Second, each group is
              assumed to have different types of nonstochastic and stochastic
              components. Third, the time series spans for the groups are
              assumed to be all different. Fourth, the alternative where some
              groups have a unit root and others do not can be dealt with by the
              tests. The tests can also be used for the null of stationarity and
              for cointegration, once relevant changes are made in the model,
              hypotheses, assumptions and underlying tests. The main idea for
              our unit root tests is to combine p-values from a unit root test
              applied to each group in the panel data. Combining p-values to
              formulate tests is a common practice in meta-analysis. This paper

              root tests and Im et al.'s [Mimeo (1995)] t-bar test. The results

              by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS); and
              spectrally-resolved water-leaving radiances (or remote-sensing
              reflectances) in the visible domain, and chlorophyll-a
              concentration are identified as required ECV products. Time series
              of the products at the global scale and at high spatial
              resolution, derived from ocean-colour data, are key to studying
              the dynamics of phytoplankton at seasonal and inter-annual scales;
              their role in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; the
              modulation of how phytoplankton distribute solar-induced heat in
              the upper layers of the ocean; and the response of the marine
              ecosystem to climate variability and change. However, generating a
              long time series of these products from ocean-colour data is not a
              trivial task: algorithms that are best suited for climate studies
              have to be selected from a number that are available for
              atmospheric correction of the satellite signal and for retrieval
              of chlorophyll-a concentration; since satellites have a finite
              life span, data from multiple sensors have to be merged to create
              a single time series, and any uncorrected inter-sensor biases
              could introduce artefacts in the series, e.g., different sensors
              monitor radiances at different wavebands such that producing a
              consistent time series of reflectances is not straightforward.
              Another requirement is that the products have to be validated
              against in situ observations. Furthermore, the uncertainties in
              the products have to be quantified, ideally on a pixel-by-pixel
              basis, to facilitate applications and interpretations that are
              consistent with the quality of the data. This paper outlines an
              approach that was adopted for generating an ocean-colour time
              series for climate studies, using data from the MERIS (MEdium
              spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor of the European
              Space Agency; the SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor)
              and MODIS-Aqua (Moderate-resolution Imaging
              Spectroradiometer-Aqua) sensors from the National Aeronautics and
              Space Administration (USA); and VIIRS (Visible and Infrared
              Imaging Radiometer Suite) from the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration (USA). The time series now covers the
              period from late 1997 to end of 2018. To ensure that the products
              meet, as well as possible, the requirements of the user community,
              marine-ecosystem modellers, and remote-sensing scientists were
              consulted at the outset on their immediate and longer-term
              requirements as well as on their expectations of ocean-colour data
              for use in climate research. Taking the user requirements into
              account, a series of objective criteria were established, against
              which available algorithms for processing ocean-colour data were
              evaluated and ranked. The algorithms that performed best with
              respect to the climate user requirements were selected to process
              data from the satellite sensors. Remote-sensing reflectance data
              from MODIS-Aqua, MERIS, and VIIRS were band-shifted to match the
              wavebands of SeaWiFS. Overlapping data were used to correct for
              mean biases between sensors at every pixel. The remote-sensing
              reflectance data derived from the sensors were merged, and the
              selected in-water algorithm was applied to the merged data to
              generate maps of chlorophyll concentration, inherent optical
              properties at SeaWiFS wavelengths, and the diffuse attenuation
              coefficient at 490 nm. The merged products were validated against

               describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain,
               environmental data used in modelling species distributions are
               often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for
               interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are
               sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage.
               Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore
               subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration
               of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative
               configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine
               the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to
               describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California
               Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace
               glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin
               mako sharks Isurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from
               the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We
               used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental
               improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify
               the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer
               depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic
               subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory
               power for most species. Model predictive performance also
               significantly improved, but only for species that had strong
               affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako
               sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common

               paralarvae hatch. Because of this relatively long duration and
               squid’s pelagic life history, egg cases provide a practical life
               stage to survey. During 2001–2002, squid egg beds in Monterey

               surveyed using a remotely operated vehicle with the goal of
               delineating the habitat of egg beds that are spawned during
               active commercial fishing. Egg cases were highly aggregated and
               densities reached 1338 capsules m−2. Squid eggs were
               significantly shallower in Central California. Egg cases occurred
               between 20 and 93 m around the Channel Islands, and in Central
               California they were between 13 and 61 m. The temperatures in
               both regions were similar (10–12 °C), with some eggs in Southern

               found on sand, suggesting that temperature and substrate are
               stronger behavioral cues than depth to stimulate spawning.
               Suitable spawning habitat was defined by three criteria: sandy
               benthic substrate, temperatures between 10 and 14.4 °C, and

               surveys of benthos and environmental variables, (2) SCUBA
               surveys, and (3) bottom measurements of T, S, pH, and O2. Here,
               embryo habitat is defined using embryo capsule density, capsule
               bed area, consistent bed footprint, and association with [O2] and
               pH (pCO2) on the shelf. Spatial variation in embryo capsule
               density and location appears dependent on environmental
               conditions, whereas the temporal pattern of year-round spawning
               is not. Embryos require [O2] greater than 160 µmol and pHT
               greater than 7.8. Temperature does not appear to be limiting
               (range: 9.9°C–15.5°C). Dense embryo beds were observed
               infrequently, whereas low-density cryptic aggregations were
               common. Observations of dense embryo aggregation in response to
               shoaling of low [O2] and pH indicate habitat compression.
               Essential embryo habitat likely expands and contracts in space
               and time directly with regional occurrence of appropriate O2 and
               pH exposure. Embryo habitat will likely be at future risk of
               compression given secular trends of deoxygenation and
               acidification within the Southern California Bight. Increasingly

               this work we aimed to plan for regionally feasible networks of
               MPAs that can be ecologically linked with an existing one in a
               transboundary context. We illustrate our exercise in the
               Ensendense eco-region, a shared marine ecosystem between the
               south of California, United States of America (USA), and the
               north of Baja California, Mexico; where conservation actions
               differ across the border. In the USA, California recently
               established a network of MPAs through the Marine Life Protection
               Act (MLPA), while in Mexico: Baja California lacks a network of
               MPAs or a marine spatial planning effort to establish it. We
               generated four different scenarios with Marxan by integrating
               different ecological, social, and management considerations
               (habitat representation, opportunity costs, habitat condition,
               and enforcement costs). To do so, we characterized and collected
               biophysical and socio-economic information for Baja California
               and developed novel approaches to quantify and incorporate some
               of these considerations. We were able to design feasible networks
               of MPAs in Baja California that are ecologically linked with
               California’s network (met between 78.5 and 84.4\% of the MLPA
               guidelines) and that would represent a low cost for fishers and
               aquaculture investors. We found that when multiple considerations
               are integrated more priority areas for conservation emerge. For
               our region, human distribution presents a strong gradient from
               north to south and resulted to be an important factor for the
               spatial arrangement of the priority areas. This work shows how,
               despite the constraints of a data-poor area, the available
               conservation principles, mapping, and planning tools can still be
               used to generate spatial conservation plans in a transboundary

              Studies of catch profiles of target and bycatch species for
              different fleets and metiers are necessary for successful
              management of target species. Such studies are also needed for the
              assessment of the interactions and evaluation of the impact on the
              ecosystems. This paper presents a study of the Spanish purse-seine
              fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay during the years 2016–2019.
              It considers the species selectivity and the effect of fishing
              activities on the pelagic community by assessing the interactions
              with the endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species and
              estimating the discard sizes. For the purpose of this study, the
              metiers were defined by grouping similar catch profiles, using
              hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. This definition of
              metier goes beyond the Data Collection Framework (DCF) concepts;
              it includes specific target species, thus increasing the accuracy.
              Sampling conducted at sea during the four years of the study
              demonstrated that; 1) the discards were scarce both in terms of
              overall values and the proportion of the catch (below 1\% for
              almost all metiers and years); 2) The studied purse-seine fishery
              is one of the most selective among those harvesting the pelagic
              domain in the Bay of Biscay; 3) The results also showed that the
              fleet avoided the unwanted catches, mostly by practising
              slipping;4) The interaction with the ETPs was almost non-existent.
              Only a single case of a yellow-legged gull entanglement was
              recorded, and the bird was released alive. Notably, more than 7500
              individuals of 16 species of seabirds and marine mammals were
              recorded in the vicinity of the fishing grounds. Thus, we conclude
              that this purse-seine fishery has only a slight impact on the main
              species of the pelagic ecosystem, due to the purse-seine slipping
              practices.",

               experienced by northern anchovy, Pacific hake, and Pacific
               sardine which were collapsed 29?40\% of the time, prior to

               was 8 years for anchovy but 22 years for sardine and hake.
               Further, we find that sardine and anchovy are positively

               invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass,
               recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of
               the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and
               international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295
               fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks
               representing 12 families), including nine of the world’s 10
               largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large
               marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions,
               and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic
               Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New

               high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database
               provides new insight into the status of exploited populations:
               58\% of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to
               be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield
               (BMSY) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation
               rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate
               that the database will facilitate new research in population
